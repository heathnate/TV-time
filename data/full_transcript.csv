1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Hey, there.",1900-01-01 00:04:13,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,What the hell?,1900-01-01 00:04:17,Milchick
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,That’s okay. Not a problem. Wanna give it another shot? Maybe with a little oomph?,1900-01-01 00:04:17,Helly

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Wow. You’re an inquisitive one.,1900-01-01 00:04:45,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"I don’t wanna be in there, do I?",1900-01-01 00:04:51,Milchick
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"You’re learning that you do. Hey, when we heard you were coming here, it was like a miracle. It’s amazing what you’re doing.",1900-01-01 00:04:52,Helly

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Like nothing?,1900-01-01 00:08:58,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, you get used to it. I mean, I find it helps to focus on the effects of sleep since we don’t actually get to experience it. You may feel rejuvenated or happy. Less tense in the shoulders. Spry.",1900-01-01 00:08:59,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,So it’s 09:05?,1900-01-01 00:09:14,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, they stagger the entries too so we don’t meet on the outside. It’s important apparently.",1900-01-01 00:09:16,Helly

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,No.,1900-01-01 00:09:39,Dylan
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"I’ve got it 96% sorted, which means I’ve earned four of the five tier incentives, including the erasers and the finger traps that you see displayed here. 100% is tier five. That gets you a caricature portrait. You’ll note I’ve accrued an embarrassment of wealth in that regard.",1900-01-01 00:09:39,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Wow.,1900-01-01 00:09:57,Dylan
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Correct.,1900-01-01 00:09:57,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Each one of these? Finished file in the can.,1900-01-01 00:09:58,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,So that’s the highest award?,1900-01-01 00:10:01,Dylan
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"Percentage-wise, yes. But if we hit our numbers by quarter’s end, one of us gets named refiner of the quarter, and that shit gets you a waffle party.",1900-01-01 00:10:03,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"I’m sorry, a waffle party?",1900-01-01 00:10:11,Dylan
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"Okay, hazards on, eager lemur. I’m a dead lock for that this quarter, so don’t get your hopes up.",1900-01-01 00:10:12,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,What about Mark’s crystal head cube?,1900-01-01 00:10:20,Dylan
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"That’s not a prize, that’s just something they gave him.",1900-01-01 00:10:22,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Helly, could you flip on this console?",1900-01-01 00:10:25,Dylan
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,1900-01-01 00:10:44,Irving
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,That’s… Excuse me.,1900-01-01 00:10:48,Irving
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Mark, sorry to interrupt. I know you’re training Helly. I just noticed you’ve removed the group photos from the desks.",1900-01-01 00:10:56,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. We’re gonna take the new ones at Helly’s party today.,1900-01-01 00:11:02,Irving
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Hmm.,1900-01-01 00:11:07,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, this is the Siena file. Now, all the data you see falls into one of four essential categories. And we group each line of code, and then sort it evenly between five digital buckets.",1900-01-01 00:11:08,Irving
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Party.,1900-01-01 00:11:24,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Just poke around first. Use the arrows.,1900-01-01 00:11:25,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I do think the old photos are supposed to stay on the desk until the new ones come in.,1900-01-01 00:11:27,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Right.,1900-01-01 00:11:39,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Should this mean something to me?,1900-01-01 00:11:41,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,No.,1900-01-01 00:11:41,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"No, all the data comes from upstairs fully encoded.",1900-01-01 00:11:43,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Then how do I categorize it?,1900-01-01 00:11:47,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,What?,1900-01-01 00:11:51,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Each category of numbers presents in such an order as to elicit an emotional response in the refiner. So, Cat 1 numbers, for example, feel a certain way on sight. They’ll be sort of disconcerting, scary.",1900-01-01 00:11:53,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Scary?,1900-01-01 00:12:10,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,I know.,1900-01-01 00:12:11,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,My job is to scroll through this spreadsheet and look for numbers that are scary?,1900-01-01 00:12:13,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"It sounds dumb, and Mark said it dumb.",1900-01-01 00:12:16,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Are the numbers bloody? Do they chant?,1900-01-01 00:12:19,Dylan
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"It doesn’t make sense till you see it, and it takes a while to see.",1900-01-01 00:12:22,Irving
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Hey, Mark. I just printed out the passage of the handbook on changing out group photos. Just might be good to peruse when you’re between things.",1900-01-01 00:12:24,Mark

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Sorry.,1900-01-01 00:12:32,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Am I trapped here?,1900-01-01 00:12:37,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,In what way?,1900-01-01 00:12:41,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Like if it turns out I hate this and I want to quit, is that an option?",1900-01-01 00:12:42,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Look. If you’re really unhappy, you can submit a resignation request with your outside self for review.",1900-01-01 00:12:50,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,And good luck getting that approved.,1900-01-01 00:12:58,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, they do tend to be rejected. Plus, you know…",1900-01-01 00:13:00,Dylan
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,What?,1900-01-01 00:13:05,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, since this perceptual version of you only exists at Lumon, I mean, quitting would effectively end your life. I mean, in so much as you’ve come to know it.",1900-01-01 00:13:07,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Hello, Refiners.",1900-01-01 00:13:19,Dylan

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Helly, welcome.",1900-01-01 00:13:24,Irving
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"I’m agog at how well I can tell you’re already fitting in. The office feels whole. Now, let’s get this party started.",1900-01-01 00:13:27,Irving
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Well, my name is Irving, as you all know. And I’ve worked here for three years, and something about me is that I know all nine core Lumon principles.",1900-01-01 00:13:44,Milchick

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Sure you do, Helly.",1900-01-01 00:14:47,Helly

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,They’re us on the outside.,1900-01-01 00:15:03,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,You saw yours yesterday in the video.,1900-01-01 00:15:06,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Right. I actually have a few things to say to her. Can I record something back?,1900-01-01 00:15:08,Milchick
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"So, what you’ll find here is that communication between selves is pretty curtailed.",1900-01-01 00:15:14,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"So, what if I write her a note?",1900-01-01 00:15:18,Milchick
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Fortunately, the elevators are equipped with something called “code detectors.” So messages can’t be passed through.",1900-01-01 00:15:20,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah… They’re like metal detectors for written symbols. A Lumon original, apparently.",1900-01-01 00:15:27,Milchick
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,That’s right. Right.,1900-01-01 00:15:31,Helly

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"I don’t think you’re quite getting the game here, Helly. May I?",1900-01-01 00:15:34,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Guys, this is Helly. She’s thirty years old, she’s allergic to almonds and has weak enamel. At 5′6″, she’s the fourth tallest person in your office, and her hair is what we call shoulder-length. And seeing her here with you all, I’d say she most definitely has a family.",1900-01-01 00:15:42,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Wow. Well, that’s a lot to follow. So, I’ll just say that I’m Mark. Been with Lumon about two years, and I absolutely love this game.",1900-01-01 00:16:06,Milchick

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,That tracks. I have similar worries.,1900-01-01 00:17:00,Mark

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I recall this. I objected.,1900-01-01 00:17:13,Milchick
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Thank you for telling me, Mark. I actually find your reaction sweet. Though, it is puzzling you have an outburst like this for Petey, and not for, say, Carol D.",1900-01-01 00:17:19,Irving
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"But we knew Carol D. was leaving beforehand. I mean, her Outie filmed a thank-you. Petey was just gone.",1900-01-01 00:17:33,Milchick

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"That’s enough, please.",1900-01-01 00:17:51,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,I think this is a good time to remind ourselves that things like deaths happen outside of here. Not here. A life at Lumon is protected from such things. And I think a great potential response to that from all of you is gratitude.,1900-01-01 00:18:02,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,I also think that melon isn’t getting any tastier.,1900-01-01 00:18:30,Mark

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"So, how are you gonna figure out if Petey’s okay?",1900-01-01 00:19:18,Mark
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,I think Milchick was pretty clear.,1900-01-01 00:19:20,Helly
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,You’re just done asking about your best friend because our babysitter told you to stop?,1900-01-01 00:19:24,Mark

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,I just think I’m not gonna work here anymore. Sorry.,1900-01-01 00:20:22,Milchick

2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Lumon Building,"Hi. You probably don't recognize me from this angle. I'm the Lumon Administrative Building, branch 501. And you're sitting in me right now. The name's a mouthful, or as I say, a “doorful.” So you can just call me Lumon. I've gone through a lot of changes since my siring here in 1870. But one thing I've always had is a love for my workers, both unsevered and severed. Not to brag, but my basement floor is one of the premier severed workspaces in the 206 countries from which Lumon operates. Hey, no running in my halls! That tickles. But what makes a building truly happy? This question came to light when four MDR workers, dissatisfied with their severed lives, conspired to mount what Lumon historians will forever call the Macrodat Uprising. Under my literal nose unfolded a human drama of danger and intrigue. Righteous anger.",1900-01-01 00:26:22,Milchick

2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Lumon Building,"The Macrodat Uprising yielded bounteous reforms. These include tasty new snacks, like fruit leather, cut beans, Christmas mints, and salsa. Not sold yet? The incentives were also reformed and now range from hall passes to pineapple bobbing… to our brand-new playful mirror room. You know, it's funny. I've sat by this reflective pool my whole life, yet it took the quiet courage of four MDR heroes to show me who I really am.",1900-01-01 00:28:05,Dylan G

By end of day, each of you will choose whether you want to remain here. Not your outies, but you. If you start work on your file, I'll assume you want to stay. If not, I'll send you to the surface. No ill will. Maybe I'll even buy you a drink at a bistro one day. Like the rest of the severed floor, the break room has no cameras or microphones. Privacy shouldn't mean packing into a supply closet like so many sardines. I truly hope you all will choose to stay and enjoy what you've helped build. A new quarter. A fresh start.
