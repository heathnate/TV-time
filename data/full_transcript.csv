1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Question four, what is Mr. Eagan’s favorite breakfast?",00:03:52
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,I don’t… That one makes no sense.,00:03:57
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Right? Unknown. Question five. And as a reminder, this is the final question. To the best of your memory, what is or was the color of your mother’s eyes?",00:03:58
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,"Okay, what’s hap… What’s happening?",00:04:27

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,What the hell did you do to me?,00:04:38

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Hi, Judd.",00:08:33
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Judd,"All right, see you this evening.",00:08:44
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Yep, see you soon.",00:08:44
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,You’re breathing shitty.,00:11:16
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Sorry.,00:11:16
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,You sick?,00:11:17
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Maybe. Petey was sniffling yesterday.,00:11:19
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,"If you breathe on me, I’ll rip your larynx out.",00:11:21
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Wow. That went right to ten. I feel like ripping out my germ-ridden larynx would get you sicker than just me breathing on you.,00:11:23
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Oh.,00:11:33
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,"Petey better not be out for the day, ’cause I’m about zero seconds from wrapping the Tumwater file, and he needs to process it.",00:11:35
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,I think he’s out.,00:11:40
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,"If he doesn’t process today, they won’t know until Tuesday of next week. It’s typical Lumon bullshit.",00:11:43
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Careful, guy.",00:11:47
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,"Hi, kids. What’s for dinner?",00:11:50
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,"Goddamn it, Irv. We warned you.",00:11:52
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,About the greeting? You were kidding.,00:11:54
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,"No, we sincerely hate it. How many reasons did we come up with?",00:11:55
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Eight.,00:12:00
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,Eight reasons.,00:12:00
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,Chief among them the latent condescension.,00:12:02
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"And it’s confusing. Like, did the kids make you dinner in this scenario? Or…",00:12:05
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,Yeah. What kind of a shit dad are you?,00:12:08
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,No Petey?,00:12:12
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,We think he’s sick.,00:12:12
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,"Oh, no. And Dylan’s about to wrap Tumwater today.",00:12:14
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,"Yeah, and if he doesn’t see me finish, I might get passed over for refiner of the quarter and miss out on my goddamn waffle party.",00:12:17
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,"Grumble, grumble. These perks are so out of hand. When we’d process a file in the old days, they’d shake our hand and fill up the creamer.",00:12:23
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,I still don’t buy they actually incentivized creamer.,00:12:30
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,"They did. And back then, we were grateful for it.",00:12:32
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,"That’s fucked, dude.",00:12:35
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,"Yes, very fucked. To put in an honest day’s work and not get a children’s breakfast in return.",00:12:37
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Dylan,Irv’s got claws today.,00:12:43
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,"Good morning, Macrodata Refinement.",00:12:46
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,"Hi, Mr. Milchick.",00:12:49
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,"Mark, could I have a word?",00:12:51
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,"Last time you saw Ms. Cobel, she was in her old office. Now she’s in her new office. It’s a completely different office.",00:13:23
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,What’s this about?,00:13:31
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,"She’d never say so, but I know a compliment about the office would just make her day.",00:13:32
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,Mark? Come in. Shut the thing.,00:13:47
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Nice office.,00:13:51
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,It’s horrid.,00:13:52
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, the old one was better.",00:13:55
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,Oh… You look awful. You look hungover. Have a seat.,00:14:04
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,The Board will be joining us remotely today.,00:14:15
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,I have Mark S. at my desk.,00:14:20
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, uh, hello. I assume this is about me acting as department chief today. Okay. Well… I mean, I’ve subbed for Petey before, so it shouldn’t be that big a thing.",00:14:32
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,Petey is no longer with this company.,00:14:47
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,I’m sorry?,00:14:52
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,"I said, Petey is no longer with this company.",00:14:54
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,"I’m sorry, Mark. You guys were one of my favorite office friendships.",00:14:59
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"I mean, there should have been some notice of this. What happened?",00:15:06
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,"We’d love to tell you, but unfortunately, non-disclosure policy forbids. We’d be aiding an assault on Petey’s privacy by you.",00:15:10
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,"Mark, would you place your key card on my desk?",00:15:20
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,"Mark S., at this time I confer upon you the freedom to serve Kier in the advanced role of Macrodata Refinement department chief. Congratulations.",00:15:29
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,"Oh, a handshake is available upon request.",00:15:49
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Thank you. May I have a handshake?,00:15:58
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,"I know you haven’t run a training before, but Irving will be there to shadow. Just stick to the flowchart and escalate properly depending on dialectics. You’ll be fine.",00:16:07
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,If you need to take a few minutes…,00:16:17
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Thank you. I don’t.,00:16:17
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, and, uh, thank you to the Board as well.",00:16:23
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,The Board won’t be contributing to this meeting vocally.,00:16:28
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,"Our last refiner, who was a woman, was…",00:16:43
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Carol. Dylan’s old seat.,00:16:46
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,Don’t be sad.,00:16:51
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,I’m fine. We’ll be fine.,00:16:52
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,I know you and Petey were close. He was the only one who really appreciated your humor.,00:16:54
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Everything’s fine. So, I’m supposed to start with just the input survey? Isn’t that a little weird?",00:17:00
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,"It’s standard. Just start at 1A and continue by line, based on her answers.",00:17:05
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, what if I just talk to her?",00:17:10
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,She deserves to have the information presented to her in the proper order. Just as you had.,00:17:12
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"“If the trainee becomes agitated and demands to leave, skip to page 19.”",00:17:17
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,She has to ask three times for you to let her.,00:17:24
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Right. Yes.,00:17:27
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Image is good.,00:17:33
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,She looks nice.,00:17:36
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,Okay. You’re all set.,00:17:39
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,I just love seeing you all come in like this.,00:17:44
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,Go on ahead when you’re ready.,00:17:48
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,All right.,00:17:53

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:18:42
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Hi there, you on the table. I wonder if you’d mind taking a brief survey.",00:18:45
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,Who is that?,00:18:51
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Five questions. Now, I know you’re sleepy, but I just bet it’ll make you feel right as rain.",00:18:53
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,Who’s speaking?,00:19:01

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Irving,She’s going to break in.,00:19:41
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,Let me out!,00:19:43
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"No, she’s not.",00:19:43
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,Are you seeing this?,00:19:46
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,I’m watching.,00:19:48
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,Should I help?,00:19:51
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,You should not.,00:19:54
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,That’s a perfect score.,00:20:02
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Now, I think I know where our disconnect is coming from.",00:20:05
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:20:10
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, there was a preamble, which I was supposed to read before the survey, to lead into the questions and… But I unfortunately skipped that and went straight into the survey.",00:20:10
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,Am I livestock?,00:20:22
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,I’m sorry?,00:20:24
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,"Like, did you grow me as food and that’s why I have no memories?",00:20:26

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"You see, you have been hired to a position on the Severed Floor of Lumon Industries.",00:21:25
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,The what floor?,00:21:31
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"I understand you’re confused about the severance procedure. Before we hop on that, let’s chat about something I bet you have heard of, the work/life balance. To start, imagine yourself as a seesaw.",00:21:44
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Ow! Fuck!,00:22:01
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,That locks from out there!,00:22:02

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"You know, few years back, I woke up on this table. In this room. And a disembodied voice asked me 19 times who I was.",00:22:53
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"And when I realized I couldn’t answer, I told that voice that I would find him and kill him.",00:23:07
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"I don’t know why I said that. I mean, I was scared too.",00:23:16

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,Let me the fuck out of here!,00:23:56
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Ask me again.,00:24:07
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:24:07
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,You’ve asked twice to be let go. Ask one more time.,00:24:10
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,Mark.,00:24:16
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Yeah?,00:24:16
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,I would like to leave the building now.,00:24:18
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"I understand you don’t feel it’s working out for you here at Lumon. While disappointed, I’d hate to keep you somewhere you’re not happy. So, let’s get you outta here.",00:24:23
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Irv.,00:24:39
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"The departments are pretty spaced out, but it’ll all fill in one day. They’re planning an expansion.",00:25:03
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,"And I’m, what, part of that?",00:25:10
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,No. You’re a replacement.,00:25:12
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,Replacement for who? Why are you saying that like you hate it?,00:25:15
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Here’s your stairwell. Just past the bend.,00:25:27
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,You’re not coming with me?,00:25:36

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,Then why the fuck can’t I leave?,00:27:27
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, you did leave, just now. Out into the stairwell at least.",00:27:29
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"You left, but you came back.",00:27:32
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,I did not.,00:27:35
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,You did. Come on.,00:27:35
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,"Weaponizing office equipment on your first day. You are gonna be fun. Look, I do sympathize. I’ve wanted to pummel Mark myself, but I am his employer. And he is your department chief. So we’ll both have to be strong. The good news is, there’s only one part left of your orientation, which Mark can’t possibly derail.",00:27:42
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,Why is that?,00:28:11
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,Because it’s a video.,00:28:12
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,"Welcome to Lumon, Helly.",00:28:22
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,Have a seat.,00:28:50

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Well…,00:29:18
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,Yes!,00:29:18
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,"You know, my mother was an atheist. She used to say that there was good news and bad news about hell. The good news is, hell is just the product of a morbid human imagination. The bad news is, whatever humans can imagine, they can usually create.",00:29:22
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,I don’t know what that means.,00:29:47
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,A department like yours can go so good or so bad. You know what makes the difference? The people.,00:29:51
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,You can have a seat.,00:30:16
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Milchick,"Okay, go ahead and have a seat.",00:30:31
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Helly,"My name is Helly R. I’m making this video roughly two hours before it will be shown to me. I have, of my own free accord, elected to undergo the procedure colloquially known as severance. I give consent for my perceptual chronologies to be surgically split, separating my memories between my work life and my personal life. I acknowledge that, henceforth, my access to my memories will be spatially dictated. I will be unable to access outside recollections whilst on Lumon’s severed basement floor, nor retain work memories upon my ascent. I am aware that this alteration is comprehensive and irreversible. I make these statements freely.",00:30:44

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,Yep.,00:37:55
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,You remember that time when we were kids and I was a way better sibling than you?,00:37:57

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Something from work, and they apologized.",00:38:15
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,They apologized. Thank God. Did they tack an explanation onto that apology?,00:38:18
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,It’s fine. Got a gift card.,00:38:22

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,Right.,00:39:00
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,"You’ve got life,",00:39:00
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,"this complex quality of sentience and activity. And then you’ve got food, which is what?",00:39:02
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,"Yes, what is it?",00:39:09
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,Fuel.,00:39:09
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,Calories. It’s not the same thing.,00:39:11
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,"Yes, that is spot on, Patton.",00:39:13
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Rebeck,I definitely agree.,00:39:13
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,"Though, if I’m…Sorry, Mark and my dad used to have “whiskey is life” carved on a flask.",00:39:15
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,True.,00:39:24
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,It was low-hanging fruit.,00:39:24
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,He did. He was a misdiagnosed alcoholic.,00:39:26
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,"Now, Mark, Ricken told Rebeck and me that you’re a former history professor.",00:39:28
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:39:32
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,"So, I’m curious for your take on all of this. The food v life of it.",00:39:33
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, I’m not sure. I taught mostly about World War I.",00:39:41
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,"Okay. Well, I got one for you. I was just reading this think piece about the comparative levels of violence and warfare throughout history.",00:39:44
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Nerd alert.,00:39:53
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,"War porn, I know.",00:39:54
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,"But anyway, in it, he said that the people actually called it the Great War. Apparently, it would have been a faux pas to have called it World War I.",00:39:56
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Is that right?,00:40:06
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, you know, no one would’ve called it World War I ’cause World War II hadn’t happened yet.",00:40:11
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,Wow.,00:40:21
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Of course.,00:40:21
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,That’s absolutely right.,00:40:23
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Duh.,00:40:23
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Rebeck,That’s so true.,00:40:25
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,This is why we bring this guy.,00:40:26
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,"Mark’s late wife, Gemma, was an educator as well. Russian literature.",00:40:28
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Rebeck,I love literature.,00:40:32
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Right?,00:40:32
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,But Mark is a Lumon man now.,00:40:35
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,Ricken.,00:40:37
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,Really?,00:40:37
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. About two years.,00:40:39
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Rebeck,Do you design the medicines?,00:40:41
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,No.,00:40:41
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,I thought Lumon was more on the tech side of things.,00:40:43
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,They began in the 1800s.,00:40:45
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Really?,00:40:45
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,"Topical salves, right?",00:40:47
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Rebeck,What don’t they make?,00:40:49
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, but I’m in the corporate archives division, so…",00:40:51
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,So you know all the dirty secrets.,00:40:54
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"No, not really.",00:40:57
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,No.,00:40:57
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Mark’s work is sensitive enough as to require the severance procedure.,00:40:59
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,Well.,00:41:07
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,"That’s something, isn’t it?",00:41:10
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,"Yeah. It’s also, I think, something that’s his choice to tell people or not.",00:41:14
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,"Right, Ricken?",00:41:17
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,"Oh, my God.",00:41:17
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,No. No.,00:41:18
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,"Oh, God, Mark.",00:41:18
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Please forgive me.,00:41:20
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,No. It’s okay. I don’t care.,00:41:20
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,My apologies.,00:41:22
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,"No, I think it’s fascinating.",00:41:22
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,"I mean, I wish I could do it. I’d just always be thinking about, you know, the other one.",00:41:25
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, there is no other one. It’s me. I do the job.",00:41:34
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,I just don’t grasp the visceral element. What does it feel like?,00:41:40
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,"Well, it’s simple. One’s memories are bifurcated, so when you’re not at work, you have no recollection of what it is you do there. Did I get that right, Mark?",00:41:48
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, it’s…",00:41:56
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,"So you walk in at 9:00 a.m.,",00:41:56
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,"and then suddenly it’s 5:00, and you’re leaving?",00:41:59
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, they stagger us a little, so…",00:42:01
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,They stagger you?,00:42:01
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,"And then, conversely, when you’re at work, you can’t access outside memories. So, in effect, that version of you is trapped there.",00:42:04
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Well…,00:42:11
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,"Well, I mean, not trapped, but…",00:42:13
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,But what?,00:42:13
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"No, no. I’m curious. What were you gonna say? But not trapped, but what? What were you gonna say?",00:42:20
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,"So, I suppose we know where you fall on the congressional goings-on.",00:42:32
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,"Okay, I think we may be",00:42:35
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,missing the point here.,00:42:36
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,Yeah.,00:42:36
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,"The point is that Mark made a decision. And that decision was controversial, ethically and socially. Morally. Scientifically. But, Mark, I stand behind you without reservation.",00:42:39
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Danise,So well said.,00:42:56
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Thank you.,00:42:56
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,Absolutely.,00:42:58
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Rebeck,I definitely stand behind Mark.,00:42:58
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Wow. Thank you. That’s very sweet.,00:43:02
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,"Well, we’re at the point where, traditionally, I would say something like, “Dig in.” But I must say, I do think that the lack of food has allowed us to already do so on a much deeper level.",00:43:07
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,"Oh, yeah. No, absolutely.",00:43:21
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Right?,00:43:21
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Patton,"I was saying, my friend in Lima hasn’t had a food-based dinner event in…",00:43:23
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,"If I give you $3,000, will you forgive me?",00:43:27
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, because your child is innocent of tonight’s atrocities, I’ll wait until after it’s born to murder you.",00:43:31

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,You’re not going?,00:44:01
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, the work thing’s helped.",00:44:04
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,Yeah.,00:44:08
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,I’m proud of you for taking that job. I really am. And I think she would’ve been too. I know she would’ve been.,00:44:10
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,I just feel like forgetting about her for eight hours a day isn’t the same thing as healing.,00:44:20
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,"You wanna crash here, since you’re already here?",00:44:34
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,No.,00:44:38
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,Why?,00:44:40
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Your house smells like pregnancy.,00:44:41
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,"Yeah, I’m just not grasping the visceral element of it.",00:44:47
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,"She is fun, wasn’t she?",00:44:51
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,You’re definitely staying here tonight.,00:44:53
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"No, I’m not.",00:44:53
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,"I’m making all the bedsheets myself, so I won’t finish with the big one for some time. But the twin is comfortable, and the pajamas were made on a Baltic handloom, so you’ll sleep well.",00:44:55
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Thanks. I still don’t quite get the three beds.,00:45:10
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Right.,00:45:14
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,Ricken’s colleague told us that switching out the beds as the child grows can wound that child.,00:45:14
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Irreparably.,00:45:20
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,"But if you provide said child with all of its beds upon birth, you allow it to progress across the room at its own rate.",00:45:21
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Got it. Yeah.,00:45:29
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Ricken,Yeah.,00:45:36

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,Did the prowler invading my home make you feel seen?,00:48:19
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,So seen.,00:48:21
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,"Well, there’s a bar down the hill. It’s probably just a stumbler. Speaking of which, you still smell like a distillery.",00:48:24
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"I’m sorry, I just had to drown out the memory of Mom and Dad switching out my beds",00:48:31
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Devon,You’ve been sitting on that one.,00:48:39
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,Hello.,00:49:32
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Okay. So, recycling was last night, Mrs. Selvig. Tonight’s garbage. And you keep putting your bin on my side. So…",00:49:35

1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Okay. Well, severance is pretty permanent.",00:50:56
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Petey,Yeah. Bypassing the implant wasn’t easy. I had help.,00:50:58
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"So, what, you were unhappy at work?",00:51:15
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"And instead of lodging a complaint, you…",00:51:18
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Petey,No.,00:51:18
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Petey,I tried that first. So did you.,00:51:21
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Right. Okay. So…You’ve unsevered. And now you, what, think they’re after you or something?",00:51:26
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Petey,"Yeah. “They” being Graner, who’s probably out here right now.",00:51:41
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Graner. Okay. Is that, like, a person you know or…",00:51:49
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Petey,We both know him. We don’t like him.,00:51:54
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,I see.,00:51:59
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Petey,"Nothing down there is what they say. If something happens to me, the things I know need to stay known. I’d prefer it be by a friend.",00:52:06
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"So, we’re friends?",00:52:28
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Petey,I’m your best friend. You’re my very good friend.,00:52:32
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Petey,"Mark, sorry about the card. and I know it’s not appropriate. Though I’m sure you’d be a really fucking awesome niece. We used to wonder what kind of men we were on the outside, what choices we had made and why. I used to think it would take a monster to put someone in a place like that office. Especially if the person was himself. But we’re not monsters, Mark. Not real ones.",00:53:12
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Petey,"If you don’t wanna know what’s going on down there, I won’t force it. But if you do, there’s an address on the back of this card. Go alone, and you’ll find the beginning of a very long answer.",00:53:55
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,"Mark, is that you?",00:54:34
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Hi, Mrs. Selvig.",00:54:37
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,Will you color me embarrassed for the mix-up with the bins?,00:54:39
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"No, it’s no problem.",00:54:44
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,How was dinner?,00:54:46
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Fine. I’m just, you know, tired.",00:54:48
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,"You know, my mother was a Catholic. She used to say it takes the saints eight hours to bless a sleeping child. I hope you aren’t rushing the saints.",00:54:53
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Mark,"Well, I’ll give them ample time tonight. Good night, Mrs. Selvig.",00:55:06
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,Mark.,00:55:12
1,1,Good News About Hell (Transcript),Cobel,You’re good people.,00:55:16
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"I acknowledge that, henceforth, my access to my memories will be spatially dictated. I will be unable to access outside recollections whilst on Lumon’s severed basement floor, nor retain work memories upon my ascent. I am aware that this alteration is comprehensive and irreversible. I make these statements freely.",00:00:02
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Okay, that’s a wrap. Come with me, please.",00:00:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"So, your work personage will be waking in a few hours on the severed floor. But the next time you yourself will be sentient will be this evening, in the elevator back up.",00:00:44
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Okay.,00:00:53
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,The elevator has a handrail at hip-level if you feel dizzy.,00:00:54
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Oh, man. I love seeing the sunrise on his face.",00:00:58
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,You know he used to drink three raw eggs in milk each morning?,00:01:06
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,I’ve heard.,00:01:09
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,His favorite breakfast.,00:01:10
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,We’ll get you prepped in here.,00:01:12
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Good morning, Lawrence.",00:01:15
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Lawrence,Good morning.,00:01:15
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,They say it doesn’t hurt.,00:01:43
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Just relax.,00:01:50
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Little vibration now.,00:02:07
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,I’ll be upstairs after to let you know how it went.,00:02:47
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Sorry if I freak out on you a little.,00:02:51
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Don’t worry. I’m very excited to meet you.,00:02:55
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Hey, Helly.",00:03:40
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Woah, what’s happening?",00:03:42
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Great to see you.,00:03:44
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Your orientation’s been so much fun.,00:03:46
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Uh, where am I?",00:03:51
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Okay, so sometimes when a new hire is adjusting to a severed space, we help by bringing them here to the stairwell, to experience the transition viscerally.",00:03:52
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Oh, no. I’m trying to leave?",00:04:01
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"No, no. It’s all part of the process. If you wanna spin around and head back in, that should be that.",00:04:03
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Hey, there.",00:04:13
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,What the hell?,00:04:17
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,That’s okay. Not a problem. Wanna give it another shot? Maybe with a little oomph?,00:04:17
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Hi. I’m at the stairwell. It’s going fair. No, she’s…",00:04:31
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Fuck!,00:04:39
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,I’ma call you back.,00:04:41
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Wow. You’re an inquisitive one.,00:04:45
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"I don’t wanna be in there, do I?",00:04:51
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"You’re learning that you do. Hey, when we heard you were coming here, it was like a miracle. It’s amazing what you’re doing.",00:04:52
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Hey, old-timer! One day down.",00:05:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Hey.,00:08:42
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Hey.,00:08:44
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,So it’s tomorrow now?,00:08:45
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Uh, yeah. Well, it’s Monday.",00:08:47
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,A weekend just happened?,00:08:51
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:08:51
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,I don’t even feel like I left.,00:08:53
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, that’s how nights and weekends feel here.",00:08:54
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Like nothing?,00:08:58
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, you get used to it. I mean, I find it helps to focus on the effects of sleep since we don’t actually get to experience it. You may feel rejuvenated or happy. Less tense in the shoulders. Spry.",00:08:59
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,So it’s 09:05?,00:09:14
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, they stagger the entries too so we don’t meet on the outside. It’s important apparently.",00:09:16
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,So I guess we’re not friends.,00:09:23
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Guess not.,00:09:26
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,My current file’s called “Tumwater”… which I started some 11 weeks back. “Tumwater.” All one word.,00:09:32
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Should I be taking notes?,00:09:37
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,No.,00:09:39
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"I’ve got it 96% sorted, which means I’ve earned four of the five tier incentives, including the erasers and the finger traps that you see displayed here. 100% is tier five. That gets you a caricature portrait. You’ll note I’ve accrued an embarrassment of wealth in that regard.",00:09:39
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Wow.,00:09:57
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Correct.,00:09:57
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Each one of these? Finished file in the can.,00:09:58
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,So that’s the highest award?,00:10:01
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"Percentage-wise, yes. But if we hit our numbers by quarter’s end, one of us gets named refiner of the quarter, and that shit gets you a waffle party.",00:10:03
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"I’m sorry, a waffle party?",00:10:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"Okay, hazards on, eager lemur. I’m a dead lock for that this quarter, so don’t get your hopes up.",00:10:12
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,What about Mark’s crystal head cube?,00:10:20
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"That’s not a prize, that’s just something they gave him.",00:10:22
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Helly, could you flip on this console?",00:10:25
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:10:44
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,That’s… Excuse me.,00:10:48
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Mark, sorry to interrupt. I know you’re training Helly. I just noticed you’ve removed the group photos from the desks.",00:10:56
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. We’re gonna take the new ones at Helly’s party today.,00:11:02
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Hmm.,00:11:07
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, this is the Siena file. Now, all the data you see falls into one of four essential categories. And we group each line of code, and then sort it evenly between five digital buckets.",00:11:08
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Party.,00:11:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Just poke around first. Use the arrows.,00:11:25
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I do think the old photos are supposed to stay on the desk until the new ones come in.,00:11:27
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Right.,00:11:39
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Should this mean something to me?,00:11:41
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,No.,00:11:41
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"No, all the data comes from upstairs fully encoded.",00:11:43
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Then how do I categorize it?,00:11:47
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:11:51
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Each category of numbers presents in such an order as to elicit an emotional response in the refiner. So, Cat 1 numbers, for example, feel a certain way on sight. They’ll be sort of disconcerting, scary.",00:11:53
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Scary?,00:12:10
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,I know.,00:12:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,My job is to scroll through this spreadsheet and look for numbers that are scary?,00:12:13
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"It sounds dumb, and Mark said it dumb.",00:12:16
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Are the numbers bloody? Do they chant?,00:12:19
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"It doesn’t make sense till you see it, and it takes a while to see.",00:12:22
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Hey, Mark. I just printed out the passage of the handbook on changing out group photos. Just might be good to peruse when you’re between things.",00:12:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Thank you.,00:12:32
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Sorry.,00:12:32
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Am I trapped here?,00:12:37
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,In what way?,00:12:41
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Like if it turns out I hate this and I want to quit, is that an option?",00:12:42
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Look. If you’re really unhappy, you can submit a resignation request with your outside self for review.",00:12:50
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,And good luck getting that approved.,00:12:58
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, they do tend to be rejected. Plus, you know…",00:13:00
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:13:05
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, since this perceptual version of you only exists at Lumon, I mean, quitting would effectively end your life. I mean, in so much as you’ve come to know it.",00:13:07
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Hello, Refiners.",00:13:19
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Sweet. Melon bar.,00:13:21
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Hi, Mr. Milchick.",00:13:23
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Helly, welcome.",00:13:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"I’m agog at how well I can tell you’re already fitting in. The office feels whole. Now, let’s get this party started.",00:13:27
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Well, my name is Irving, as you all know. And I’ve worked here for three years, and something about me is that I know all nine core Lumon principles.",00:13:44
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Awesome. What’s your favorite?,00:13:55
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"All nine. But today, I think I’d say, “cheer”.",00:14:00
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Great.,00:14:06
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"No trust fall today, Irv.",00:14:12
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Right.,00:14:16
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,No. No.,00:14:26
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Hello, I’m Helly. I’ve been at Lumon for, like…ten hours total, and…",00:14:35
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"I’m sorry, I don’t know anything about myself.",00:14:44
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Sure you do, Helly.",00:14:47
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"I really don’t. I guess I went home last night, but I don’t know if home is a house, or an apartment, or if I live with a family…",00:14:50
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"I like to think my Outie lives on, like, a riverboat.",00:14:57
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"I’m sorry, Outies are…",00:15:02
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,They’re us on the outside.,00:15:03
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,You saw yours yesterday in the video.,00:15:06
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Right. I actually have a few things to say to her. Can I record something back?,00:15:08
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"So, what you’ll find here is that communication between selves is pretty curtailed.",00:15:14
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"So, what if I write her a note?",00:15:18
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Fortunately, the elevators are equipped with something called “code detectors.” So messages can’t be passed through.",00:15:20
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah… They’re like metal detectors for written symbols. A Lumon original, apparently.",00:15:27
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,That’s right. Right.,00:15:31
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Sure. Okay, well what if I…",00:15:33
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"I don’t think you’re quite getting the game here, Helly. May I?",00:15:34
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Guys, this is Helly. She’s thirty years old, she’s allergic to almonds and has weak enamel. At 5′6″, she’s the fourth tallest person in your office, and her hair is what we call shoulder-length. And seeing her here with you all, I’d say she most definitely has a family.",00:15:42
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Wow. Well, that’s a lot to follow. So, I’ll just say that I’m Mark. Been with Lumon about two years, and I absolutely love this game.",00:16:06
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Nice try, pal, but you said that last time.",00:16:20
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Fair enough. Well, I…I broke protocol this morning.",00:16:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"I was dusting the old group photos, the ones with Petey, and it just…made me feel sad. And, I guess, worried that I won’t be able to run MDR like he did.",00:16:43
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,That tracks. I have similar worries.,00:17:00
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"So I…took ’em from the cubicles and put ’em in the storage closet, which we’re not supposed to do.",00:17:03
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I recall this. I objected.,00:17:13
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Thank you for telling me, Mark. I actually find your reaction sweet. Though, it is puzzling you have an outburst like this for Petey, and not for, say, Carol D.",00:17:19
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"But we knew Carol D. was leaving beforehand. I mean, her Outie filmed a thank-you. Petey was just gone.",00:17:33
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"And I mean, I… I don’t know if he’s at some new job or drunk on a beach, or dead…",00:17:43
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"That’s enough, please.",00:17:51
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,I think this is a good time to remind ourselves that things like deaths happen outside of here. Not here. A life at Lumon is protected from such things. And I think a great potential response to that from all of you is gratitude.,00:18:02
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,I also think that melon isn’t getting any tastier.,00:18:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Hey, sorry I derailed your game.",00:19:08
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"I thought I already had, but then, yeah, you made it way worse.",00:19:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"So, how are you gonna figure out if Petey’s okay?",00:19:18
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,I think Milchick was pretty clear.,00:19:20
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,You’re just done asking about your best friend because our babysitter told you to stop?,00:19:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"You know, Milchick’s a nice man. When he says something, it’s best to listen.",00:19:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,I don’t care.,00:19:35
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,’Cause he can’t always be nice like that.,00:19:35
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Okay, Refiners!",00:19:38
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Let’s get this new group photo before the melon bloat sets in.,00:19:40
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,At last.,00:19:55
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"All right. Great big smiles. Remember, you’re gonna be looking at this every day.",00:19:59
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Say “gratitude.”,00:20:06
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Refiners,Gratitude!,00:20:08
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Say “cheer.”,00:20:12
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Refiners,Cheer!,00:20:14
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Helly? What are you doing?,00:20:20
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,I just think I’m not gonna work here anymore. Sorry.,00:20:22
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,What do you mean?,00:20:26
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,I quit.,00:20:27
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,I don’t wanna do the file-sorting thing or the never-seeing-the-sun-thing or the disappearing-friends thing.,00:20:29
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,I just don’t want any of it.,00:20:33
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,We told you there’s code detectors.,00:20:33
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Do you know that? Have you tried? Because frankly, it sounds made-up.",00:20:35
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Helly!,00:20:47
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Helly!,00:20:52
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Please, you don’t know…",00:21:04
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Oh, God. Come on.",00:21:09
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Shit. Mr. Graner?,00:21:20
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Graner,Come on out.,00:21:26
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Graner,What have we got here?,00:21:33
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Graner,Perhaps you’d better come with me.,00:21:38
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Mr. Graner.,00:21:39
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Hey. I see you’ve found my wayward trainee. Appreciate your help, sir, as always.",00:21:43
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"The note. So, this is embarrassing, but it’s my first time training, and I must’ve just forgotten to go over data-smuggling rules with Helly.",00:21:53
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Sorry. This is Helly. Helly, Mr. Graner.",00:22:05
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:22:08
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, so if Helly tripped the code detectors, that one, it’s on me and I apologize for that, sir. Earnestly.",00:22:12
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Graner,"Big department chief now, Mark S.?",00:22:22
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Well…,00:22:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Graner,"On you, then. Let’s go.",00:22:27
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,Mark.,00:23:46
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"So, you’re a doula?",00:23:51
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,"A midwife, actually.",00:23:53
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"And how many deliveries have you, I don’t know, seen?",00:23:57
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,Over 300? This is mostly back in Montana.,00:24:05
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Wow. That’s so cool.,00:24:09
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,Yeah.,00:24:09
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,That’s such a high amount.,00:24:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,Yeah. We get two a day. Depending.,00:24:14
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"So, is that, like, ten a week? Like, in a five-day work week, or…",00:24:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,"Yeah, or so.",00:24:34
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. Okay.,00:24:34
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,Are you vetting me for your sister?,00:24:37
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"No. Oh, no. You seem great.",00:24:37
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,"Yeah, I’m kidding.",00:24:41
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,I know.,00:24:41
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Thank you.,00:24:52
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,"So, Lumon?",00:24:53
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:24:57
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,Like half this town.,00:24:57
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,And half of me. That was a joke.,00:24:59
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,It was funny.,00:25:02
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah. I’m in the archives division, sort of a corporate historian, apparently. So, a lot of sensitive",00:25:04
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,"So, you don’t know…who you work with, or what you do, or… or anything?",00:25:16
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, that’s the idea.",00:25:23
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,What if you snuck in a note?,00:25:25
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,You can’t sneak notes.,00:25:25
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,So…,00:25:27
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,you could have a girlfriend at Lumon…,00:25:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Thank you.,00:25:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,"…and not know it. And if you met someone out here, you wouldn’t know it in there. Like, you could get married and have kids, and just forget they exist for eight hours every day, for your whole life.",00:25:31
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,That doesn’t mess with your head?,00:25:42
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"I think for some people, it’s the point.",00:25:47
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,"So, as a local, this just feels like a reasonable temperature to you?",00:25:55
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, technically, I’m from Ganz. And you’re one to talk. Isn’t Minnesota, like, crazy cold with the lakes?",00:25:59
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,Yes. Minnesota was very cold the one time I visited from my home in Montana.,00:26:08
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,So those are different places.,00:26:15
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,So do you live in Lumon housing?,00:26:20
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,You make it sound like dorms or something.,00:26:23
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,"No, I just meant that there’s…",00:26:26
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,I live in Baird Creek.,00:26:26
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"And, yes, they happen to be subsidized by the company that employs me.",00:26:28
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,"Excuse me, do you have a moment for children’s brain health?",00:26:33
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 2,And legalized severance in the workplace?,00:26:35
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Nice. The WMC’s out and about.,00:26:38
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,Who?,00:26:38
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,Most severed workers don’t see the sun their whole lives.,00:26:41
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,The Whole Mind Collective. They’re great.,00:26:44
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,"Excuse me, do you have a moment for children’s brain health?",00:26:46
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),MAN ON SIDEWALK,We’re all good.,00:26:49
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,You folks have a moment for children’s brain health?,00:26:50
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,We do.,00:26:52
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,Great!,00:26:52
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,We’re trying to get a measure on the ballot to keep mega-corporations like Lumon from continuing to force legalized severance on our state.,00:26:53
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,They’re forcing it now?,00:26:59
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 2,That’s what they’re lobbying for. And Jame Eagan is trying to sever kids…,00:27:00
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, well, what about the self-mutilating types who do it willingly? I mean, I heard that some of them are so deluded they don’t even know they’re victims. I also heard that if you’re severed, you go to two separate hells. Is that true?",00:27:03
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,"Hey, man, you wanna benefit off forced labor, that’s up…",00:27:17
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Hey, man. Forced labor?",00:27:19
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,…then that’s up to you.,00:27:19
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Fucking really?,00:27:22
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Alexa,Hey!,00:27:23
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,Yeah.,00:27:23
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Forced labor? Okay.,00:27:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,Really.,00:27:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"So people can just, like, self-imprison? Are you captive right now? No, seriously, because your past self chose to walk you down here to be an infantilizing prick to people.",00:27:26
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),WMC Activist 1,"Severance is subjugation, asshole.",00:27:36
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,That’s nice language for a… What… What are you? Twelve? Are you 12 years old? Are you even in high school yet?,00:27:40
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Okay. Come on.,00:27:49
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Mrs. Selvig.,00:28:21
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,Peace offering.,00:28:23
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Are we fighting?,00:28:25
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,I just keep thinking about those damn bins.,00:28:26
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, that is so not necessary, but very kind. Thank you.",00:28:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Here, why don’t you come in? I have milk.",00:28:38
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,"Why, thank you!",00:28:41
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:28:41
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,"I’m experimenting with chamomile, so no hard feelings if you gag.",00:28:46
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,I’m sure I won’t.,00:28:49
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,Still waiting for that third bulb to revive itself?,00:28:54
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, yeah. Keep forgetting to change that.",00:28:58
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,"My, you smell nice. Were you on a date?",00:29:01
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Sort of. My sister set me up with, like, her doula, or midwife. Didn’t really feel like anything.",00:29:05
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, let’s see here. I’ll…",00:29:19
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Wow. This i… These are magic.,00:29:32
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,"My late husband was a carpenter, and before he passed, he said he would start building us a house in the hereafter. And there would be a small guest apartment in the back, in case I found a new man before I got there.",00:29:39
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,That’s… so sweet.,00:29:58
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,"Yes. He even drew blueprints, which I keep in my purse.",00:30:02
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,"Well, come by the shop, okay? I’ll give you a mugwort bath bomb that’ll make you sleep like a rag doll.",00:30:13
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"I’ll try to get down there. Good night, Mrs. Selvig.",00:30:19
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Television,"The nerve, my new partner’s a woman.",00:31:19
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Television,I just think you could’ve mentioned it sooner.,00:31:22
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Television,You’d better be on the stakeout and not… out for a steak.,00:31:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Seth Milchick, Lumon Industries.",00:32:28
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Mr. Milchick, it’s Mark Scout. I’m a severed worker. Employee number 4502.",00:32:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Mr. Scout, what a pleasure. How can I help you?",00:32:36
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,I actually woke up not feeling terribly well. I’m sorry I’m just now calling.,00:32:39
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Oh, no. May I ask how serious it is?",00:32:44
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, nothing bad, just very minor stomach event. Should be back tomorrow.",00:32:47
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Well, I’m sorry. I know your Innie will be sad to have missed the day. You feel better. Okay, Mr. Scout?",00:32:54
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Where’s Mark?,00:33:07
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Missed you too.,00:33:07
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,He should be coming down first now. You don’t think that…,00:33:10
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,He’s probably sick. They wouldn’t bounce him and Petey the same week.,00:33:13
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"I certainly hope not. Quarterly deadline’s coming up, and I’m not looking to be department chief.",00:33:16
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Wow. Lotta confidence for a man who once got disciplined for dozing.,00:33:21
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Sorry. That was…,00:33:27
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I can’t help that I was hired older than you.,00:33:32
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"It just never stops, huh?",00:33:37
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Endless toil.,00:33:39
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Where’s Mark?,00:33:42
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Sick or fired. Probably sick.,00:33:43
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"They wouldn’t have fired him for my note thing, would they?",00:33:46
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,No. No way. He did his stint in the break room yesterday.,00:33:48
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,He said he was ill.,00:33:55
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Cobel,Did he sound ill?,00:33:56
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,I don’t know. He said it was abdominal.,00:33:58
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Graner,Funny timing.,00:34:02
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"The erasers are mostly decorative, since we don’t have pencils.",00:34:44
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"Finger trap is fun, as long as you know how to use it safely. But it’s really more about what they represent, how far you got in the file.",00:34:48
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,But why don’t we always finish the files?,00:34:54
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,’Cause they only keep so long.,00:34:54
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"You know, we finish, on average, one in five files before they expire. Which is better than it used to be before Mark’s freshman fluke.",00:34:57
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,What’s a freshman fluke?,00:35:05
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,No!,00:36:05
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Irv?,00:36:07
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I’m… I’m sorry.,00:36:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,Irving?,00:36:13
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"We’ll deduct the time you spent dozing from your Outie’s paycheck. What will be harder to fix, Irving, is my and Ms. Cobel’s trust in you.",00:37:17
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"I’m so sorry, sir. I’m just so sorry.",00:37:25
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick,"Well, no one is hankering to throw you in the break room. We’ll do a wellness check with Ms. Casey and go from there, all right?",00:37:28
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Thank you, Mr. Milchick.",00:37:35
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Nothing scary yet.,00:37:59
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Oh, God! A four!",00:38:09
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"Don’t fuck around. I told you, you’ll understand when you see it, so just be patient.",00:38:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"What even are these numbers? Like, do we even know what we’re supposedly cleaning?",00:38:16
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,My theory? The sea.,00:38:23
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,The sea?,00:38:29
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"Yeah. Think about it. Okay, if our Outies are up there severing their brains, shit must have gotten pretty bad. Famine, plagues, et cetera. So what is a desperate humanity to do?",00:38:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Populate the sea?,00:38:46
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"Populate the sea. But first, they gotta send probes down to the sea to clean up all the deadly eels and shit, ’cause we can’t cohabitate with that. So, we send the probes down, they send us the data coded, we sense what’s eels, and then we tell the probes what to blow up.",00:38:47
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,This is the leading theory?,00:39:08
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"Nah, Irv thinks we’re cutting swear words out of movies.",00:39:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"But what is it? Like, what… what are we actually workin’ on down there?",00:39:18
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Petey,"I don’t know. I thought without severance it would make more sense, but… They separate us from the other departments. We don’t even know how many there are. But I’ve been reintegrated for two weeks now. I’ve been mapping out the floor. I hid the original for you when I left.",00:39:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,You okay?,00:40:20
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Petey,Sorry. Reintegration sickness.,00:40:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Never heard of that one.,00:40:36
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Petey,"Because I’m the first dipshit that’s ever had it. Plus, living in a cold-ass greenhouse doesn’t help, but I can’t go home.",00:40:38
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, so what is it that happens down there that’s so bad?",00:40:49
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Petey,There’s this room…We go in there when we don’t act right.,00:40:57
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,What is that?,00:41:15
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick (on tape),I’m afraid you’re not sorry.,00:41:23
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark (on tape),Please. I truly am. I’m sorry.,00:41:26
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick (on tape),Please read the statement again.,00:41:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark (on tape),"Forgive me for the harm I have caused this world. None may atone for my actions but me, and only in me shall their stain live on.

1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Milchick (on tape),"I’m afraid you don’t mean it. Again, please.",00:41:56
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark (on tape),Forgive me for the harm I have caused this world. None may atone for my actions but me.,00:42:02
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,The fuck is that?,00:42:15
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Petey,That’s the break room.,00:42:19
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Burt,I’m… I’m sorry.,00:42:53
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"No, I’m sorry, sir.",00:42:54
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Burt,I didn’t think anybody was out here. I’m coming out from my session.,00:42:56
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I was just going in. I was admiring the art while I wait.,00:43:01
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Burt,That piece hung in the Perpetuity Wing for many years.,00:43:07
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I know. And it broke my heart when they took it down.,00:43:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Burt,It’s better here. It’s calming.,00:43:14
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I’m Irving. Macrodata Refinement. Are you a department head?,00:43:20
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Burt,"Well, Optics and Design. A two-person department, so, barely.",00:43:25
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"So, this is your work?",00:43:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Burt,We don’t paint them. We do hang them.,00:43:32
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I loved that you did the Ambrose cycle in the team-building space last quarter. I’d never seen it.,00:43:35
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Burt,"Well, it’s rare to meet a sophisticate. Most people only think of O&D when new handbook totes come in.",00:43:43
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Well, I love those too.",00:43:51
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Burt,"Yeah? There’s new ones coming next month. Best design yet, in my view.",00:43:53
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Wow! Well, that’s all I’ll be thinking about until then.",00:44:01
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Irving?,00:44:06
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"All right, Irving. What I’d like to do is share with you some facts about your Outie. Because your Outie is an exemplary person, these facts should be very pleasing. Just relax your body and be open to the facts. Try to enjoy each equally. These facts are not to be shared outside this room. But for now, they’re yours to enjoy.",00:44:45
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Your Outie is generous. Your Outie is fond of music and owns many records. Your Outie is a friend to children and to the elderly and the insane. Your Outie is strong and helped someone lift a heavy object. Your Outie attends many dances and is popular among the other attendees. Your Outie likes films and owns a machine that can play them. Your Outie is splendid and can swim gracefully and well.,00:45:23
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"I’m sorry. Please try to enjoy each fact equally, and not show preference for any over the others. That’s ten points off. You have 90 points remaining.",00:46:10
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Points?,00:46:22
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Please don’t speak.,00:46:22
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Your Outie won a game two weeks ago. Your Outie values water. A photo of your Outie with a trophy was once in a newspaper. Your Outie has no fear of muggers or knaves. Your Outie likes the sound of radar. Your Outie is skilled at kissing and lovemaking.,00:46:32
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Ms. Casey,I’m sorry. Please don’t respond to any specific fact. That’s ten points off.,00:47:05
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,I was just…,00:47:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"Please don’t speak further,",00:47:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Ms. Casey,or all remaining points will be deducted and the wellness session will end.,00:47:14
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Okay.,00:47:35
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Is it just the elevators?,00:47:57
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,What?,00:47:57
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,With the code detectors. Or is it the stairwells too?,00:47:59
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Jesus. Stairwells too. Why?,00:48:01
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"If no one accepts the resignations, what makes you think they’re being delivered at all?",00:48:03
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,You gotta let the info-smuggling notion go.,00:48:07
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Okay, but how good are the scanners? Like, what if you wrote the letters funky, like one of those robot tests?",00:48:10
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Hi, kids. What’s for dinner?",00:48:14
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Nope!,00:48:14
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,How was Wellness?,00:48:16
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Great. Very restorative. I met the O&D department head.,00:48:18
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,"Burt? I’ve met that guy. He’s a fuck. You didn’t tell him where we are, did you?",00:48:22
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Burt’s not a fuck. And no.,00:48:26
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,I’m asking for the safety of this department.,00:48:28
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,I don’t need to tell you…,00:48:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,That’s a myth.,00:48:30
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,And don’t pretend you care about this department. You just want your waffle party.,00:48:32
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Beg-fucking-pardon. We’re supposed to like the perks. “And all in Lumon’s care shall revel in the bounty of the incentives spur.”,00:48:35
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Don’t pervert a handbook passage to me, okay?",00:48:42
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Don’t do it.,00:48:45
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,"Hey, guys?",00:48:45
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"Lumon has been good to us, and it is feckless to…",00:48:47
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Guys!,00:48:48
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,That.,00:48:58
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Yep.,00:49:00
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,Why is… Why is it…,00:49:02
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,You okay. Just fence off the bad data like I showed you.,00:49:03
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,Can you see the perimeter?,00:49:06
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,And bin it.,00:49:17
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Dylan,Boom. Fucking refined.,00:49:31
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Irving,"All right, Helly. Hip, hip.",00:49:33
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Helly,They were scary. The numbers were scary.,00:49:36
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Here’s the couch. I’ll find you a sleeping bag. And you can use the shower if you want.,00:49:56
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Petey,What are you trying to say?,00:50:05
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Petey,"Thanks for doing this, Mark.",00:50:11
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Well, I, you know, figured my work self would be pissed if I let you sleep in a greenhouse.",00:50:13
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,Light’s on the left.,00:50:24
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,You okay in there?,00:50:53
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Petey,"Yeah! Yeah, I’m good.",00:50:54
1,2,Half Loop (Transcript),Mark,"Petey, are you okay?",00:52:09
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Petey, are you okay?",00:00:10
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Petey?,00:00:17
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"Yeah, I’m good. I just slipped. You should invest in a bath mat, maybe.",00:00:19
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, okay. The robe is a gift from my brother-in-law. I’ve never worn it or anything. Sorry, it’s weird.",00:00:25
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,I have pillows. Do you need anything else?,00:00:34
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"Yeah, I want you to stop shitting on this awesome robe.",00:00:37
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Well, you can keep it.",00:00:41
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,I will.,00:00:43
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,Hey. Are you sure nobody can see in any of these transoms?,00:00:44
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. And everything’s locked upstairs.,00:00:49
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,Anybody live in that unit next door?,00:00:53
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"No, it’s just Mrs. Selvig in the other direction. The neighborhood never really filled up, so it’s nice. Quiet.",00:00:56
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,Fortress of solitude.,00:01:06
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"I still think an occasional mixer wouldn’t hurt anything. I checked, and it’s not expressly prohibited in the manual.",00:01:08
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"Yeah, I bet! Dude, I pressed Cobel for an all-floor mixer last quarter. She said you’ll get one when you earn it, whatever that means.",00:01:15
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Cobel?,00:01:22
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,I can’t imagine Dylan’s 4% on Sunset Park’s gonna help with—,00:01:22
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Petey? You okay?,00:01:28
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,I’m sorry. Yeah. I just— I get disoriented. It’s temporary.,00:01:35
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,What’s Sunset Park?,00:01:47
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,I don’t know.,00:01:52
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"It’s like having two different lives suddenly stitched together. But the relativity’s fucked. So, my first day at Lumon’s as far back as my fifth birthday.",00:04:13
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"And with two pasts, it blurs the present too. But they said it will get better.",00:04:23
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Who’s “they”?,00:04:33
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,“They” is a group of people that know severance is a blight on mankind. And they’re gonna do something about it.,00:04:37
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,The Whole Mind Collective?,00:04:45
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"The kids trolling for signatures downtown? No, not the fucking WMC. Someone else.",00:04:47
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"All right. Well— So, what do you want from me?",00:04:55
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,Don’t you wanna know what you’re doing down there?,00:05:05
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, look. You know, I’m not gonna unsever.",00:05:12
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"Well, I don’t want you to unsever because that’s not a word.",00:05:16
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,Reintegration.,00:05:20
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"All right. Well, whatever.",00:05:20
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"You know, it hasn’t been a blight for me. It’s helped me.",00:05:23
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,Okay. What if the cost of that help is that you’re murdering people eight hours a day and you don’t even know it?,00:05:29
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Well, am I?",00:05:38
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"Look, I found a department. One they don’t tell us about. One where you don’t get to leave.",00:05:42
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Well, don’t none of us get to leave?",00:05:51
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"No, I mean you really don’t get to leave. As in, they’re down there right now.",00:05:53
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Well, what? Like, chained up, or—",00:05:58
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,What?,00:06:03
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,I’m not gonna talk about it in here. I don’t know if the monitors are bugged. Or if Irving’s gonna walk in.,00:06:09
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Petey, we’re not at Lumon.",00:06:25
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,Then where the fuck is June?,00:06:34
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"I’m sorry, Mark.",00:06:47
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Who’s June?,00:06:58
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,June is my daughter. Greatest kid on Earth and a hell of a guitar player.,00:07:02
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,How happy are you that you asked me to stay here?,00:07:13
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,"Oh, Mark. Are you all right?",00:07:46
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Steven,"But what do you say, Natalie, to the woman who became pregnant at work less than a month after her company went severed?",00:07:54
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,"Well, first, I’d suggest she reveal her identity if she wants an honest conversation",00:08:01
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,about her experience.,00:08:05
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Steven,How could she have that conversation when her workie was the one involved—,00:08:05
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,"Okay, first of all, workie?",00:08:05
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Steven,"That, as I understand, is the preferred term among—",00:08:11
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,I think it’s exactly the condescending verbiage that I’d expect from a group trying to save people from their own choices.,00:08:13
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Steven,Choices? Did her insie have a—,00:08:18
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,Insie? Where are you getting these terms?,00:08:20
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Steven,Fine. Call it someone who’s had their brain split in half—,00:08:22
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,That has nothing to do with what we do at Lumon nor any severance procedure.,00:08:25
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Steven,I understand you don’t wanna answer my questions…,00:08:29
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,I’m answering your questions.,00:08:31
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Steven,…because it’ll reveal that you are,00:08:31
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Steven,complicit in something totally immoral.,00:08:33
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,What’s immoral is—,00:08:33
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Television (voice),Tell me it’s not true.,00:08:41

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Weather Channel (voice),"…continuing through the greater basin, probably into the afternoon, just as we predicted yesterday. The good news is, those clouds should dissipate somewhere over the Ganz area, leaving a clear, sunny day, for our friends in and around Kier. That said, the cold’s not letting up anywhere. And those roads are going to remain icy throughout the week and on into the weekend. So wherever you’re headed, please do commute with care.",00:08:48
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Petey. Wake up, Petey. Petey?",00:09:20

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"No, no, no. No.",00:10:06
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,At work…you’d come in sometimes with red eyes. We had a joke that you had an elevator allergy. There was even a song for it. But I always wondered.,00:10:10
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,You carry the hurt with you. You feel it down there too. You just don’t know what it is.,00:10:32
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Okay. Why don’t you grab whatever you want up in the fridge? I should be back around 6:00.,00:10:42

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,Yesterday. You were gone.,00:12:42

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"Oh, yeah. Dylan took over training in your stead to great success.",00:12:45
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"You look trim, Mark. I wonder if you were food poisoned.",00:12:49
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,"Welcome back, boss. New photos come in?",00:12:53
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"Oh, good. You can finally get rid of those old ones.",00:12:55
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,"You may as well skip it actually, ’cause I put in my resignation request.",00:13:02
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,You did submit it?,00:13:06
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,I did.,00:13:06

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"Hello, Mr. Milchick.",00:13:16
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Milchick,"Mark, I spoke to your Outie yesterday. He sounded just shattered not to be at work. But now that you’re here, care to read your first morning announcements as department head?",00:13:17
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Sure. Should be easier without me in the audience.,00:13:27
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,Mark used to find it funny to interrupt Petey’s announcements. With gas having.,00:13:34
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, quiet down, all. I’m Mark, your new announcements person. Just a couple things here.",00:13:40
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,Why are you standing weird? Stand normal.,00:13:51
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,I’m— I’m standing great.,00:13:55
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,Are you uncomfortable? We could all look away?,00:13:57

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Ricken,How do you know?,00:15:30
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Devon,Because his car’s not here.,00:15:32
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Ricken,Maybe he played hooky.,00:15:32
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Devon,Can you go do it? ’Cause I gotta pee.,00:15:34
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Ricken,Yes.,00:15:36

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Ricken,Do you think he’ll be surprised?,00:15:58
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Devon,I do.,00:15:58

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Hey. What’s that? Sudoku?,00:17:28
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,It’s nothing.,00:17:31
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,What were you drawing?,00:17:33
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Petey,"You getting back to work, in cubist form.",00:17:34

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,"No, it’s not so bad.",00:19:44
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,Just mildly aggressive.,00:19:52
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,Did you give her directed praise?,00:19:58
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I’m coming.,00:20:02
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Hey, Helly?",00:21:09

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Okay. It’s just— It has been a while.,00:21:23
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,"I’m fine, Mark.",00:21:27
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,I think I need to come in.,00:21:27

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,I’m sorry. I’m—,00:21:41
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Writing the note directly on your skin. Well, unfortunately, the detectors can pick up lettering anywhere.",00:21:46
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,Does this look like lettering to you?,00:21:51
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Well, if you put your arms together.",00:21:53
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Not bad. I thought you were starting to, like, be okay here.",00:21:58
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,"What, ’cause I did the numbers thing?",00:22:04
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Well, you got a win. You know, a lot of people find joy in that.",00:22:06
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,It literally causes fear.,00:22:09
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,That’s just one subset of numbers. The others are more comforting—,00:22:11
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,"Mark, I don’t wanna work here with you. So don’t burst into the bathroom with your pathetic boss voice on and try to convince me that I do.",00:22:14
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, I’ll give you five minutes to scrub your arms.",00:22:24
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,Or what?,00:22:26
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Do you want Graner to use the bad soap?,00:22:29

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Irv.,00:22:44
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,I was listening at the door. I heard it all.,00:22:45
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:22:47
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,I am troubled by you having high-stress exchanges like that so fresh off your food poisoning.,00:22:47
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,It’s fine.,00:22:53
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,The loathing with which she spoke to you.,00:22:54
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Well, acclimating takes time.",00:22:57
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,And guidance.,00:22:58
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"What’s on your mind, Irving?",00:23:01
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"Dylan was going on all yesterday about incentives, pencil erasers and waffle parties, as though that’s why we’re here. That’s not why we’re here. If it’s a deeper meaning she craves, she should see the Perpetuity Wing.",00:23:05
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,She can read about all that stuff in the handbook.,00:23:21
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,You know it’s different to be there. To see it.,00:23:23
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"It just seems premature. I mean, that place is a lot.",00:23:29
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,Correct. That place is everything.,00:23:31
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Milchick,How’d the check go?,00:23:41
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,"There was a package left at his door from someone. Open it, would you?",00:23:42
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,"Oh, God.",00:23:49
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Milchick,Is this the brother-in-law?,00:23:49
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,Ricken. His fifth book.,00:23:51
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Milchick,“Chapter 12: On Learning to Be Emotionally Nude in Front of My Wife.”,00:23:57

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Sorry. I can fill out the form.,00:24:16
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,What is it? Get the door.,00:24:19
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Irving thought we should take Helly to the Perpetuity Wing today.,00:24:28
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,"Well, it’s a good thing I made Irving department chief.",00:24:31
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Sorry. I think I should take Helly and the team to the Perpetuity Wing.,00:24:34
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,And have you filled out a common-space reservation slip?,00:24:40
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"No, I—",00:24:46
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,Mark.,00:24:46
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"I’m sorry. I’ve just been— I don’t know. It’s been weird since Petey left. I mean, you know, he was— He set the tone.",00:24:48
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,"If Petey were the tone-setter you’re lionizing him as, he’d still be here.",00:25:02
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,What does that mean?,00:25:12
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,Are you gonna make me throw my mug at you?,00:25:14
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,I— Why would you—,00:25:19
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,Get MDR to its numbers.,00:25:22
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:25:22
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,Mark?,00:25:28
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,What I just did was something I knew that you could handle and grow from. It was very painful for me. I hope that you’ll let it help you.,00:25:31

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,My delts are embarrassingly good today. My Outie does muscle shows for sure.,00:26:09
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"If your Outie did muscle shows, you wouldn’t have to work here.",00:26:15
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,"I’m sorry, do you know how much muscle shows pay? No, none of us can know that.",00:26:17
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"I imagine it’s a tiered system. Perhaps there are monetary prizes for gold, silver and bronze.",00:26:21
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,No. My guess is that they do it piecemeal per muscle. So…,00:26:27
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"No, I don’t think so.",00:26:31
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,"Best delt, 30 bucks.",00:26:31
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,"Best ab, 20 bucks. Biceps are a little flashier, 75 bucks.",00:26:34
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,I would think lats carry a high value. They’re considered very attractive in muscle-building circles. And in society at large.,00:26:38
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,"Lats are bullshit, dude—",00:26:44
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,The center of a good physique.,00:26:46

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Thirsty?,00:27:04
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,"Hey, just in case you find this relevant for some reason, the code detectors can read messages hidden inside the body as well. Also, when that happens, it’s Milchick’s job to extract the message from you. And when he asks how long ago you ingested it, I really can’t recommend honesty enough. It’s easier for you both if he knows which end to start from.",00:27:09
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Another good try though.,00:27:50

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"I have a mnemonic poem to help you remember their names. I authored it myself, and of course, it falls outside corporate canon, and it’s poetically imperfect, to be sure. There’s a slant rhyme in the second verse. of “Ambrose” to “ban those,” which was necessary to further the narrative, but regrettable.",00:28:09
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,Ambrose is sometimes unfairly maligned as a black sheep in the annals of the family.,00:28:26
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,What’s this?,00:28:30
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"And it certainly wasn’t my intent to slight him further,",00:28:31

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,I wasn’t expecting— Is this about Helena?,00:30:27
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,"No, this is about Peter Kilmer. And I should tell you that the Board is joining us.",00:30:31
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,The Board would like you to speak first.,00:31:03
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,"Oh, yes. Of course.",00:31:05
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,Salutations.,00:31:07
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,"So, the search for Kilmer continues. I will say this. Not to be alarmist, but prior to his departure, there were some troubling signs of possible… reintegration.",00:31:15
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Natalie,"Okay. So, the Board is conveying pretty strongly that the severance procedure is provenly irreversible.",00:31:47
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Cobel,Yes—,00:31:56

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,And unnatural. Perverse.,00:32:41
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,O&D is nice.,00:32:43
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,"No, they’re not. Nor do they share our values. Kier sorted the departments by virtue. Macrodats are clever and true, while O&D’s more cruelty-centered.",00:32:44
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Helly,How many departments are there?,00:32:53
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,Probably 30.,00:32:54

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Mark,Nope. There was no coup. No one killed anyone.,00:33:06

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Dylan,Handsome too. See those brows?,00:34:28
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,All the center displays are for a past Eagan CEO. But the whole back part is Kier.,00:34:54
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Kier Eagan (recording),"I know that death is near upon me, because people have begun to ask what I see as my life’s great achievement. They wish to know how they should remember me as I rot. In my life, I have identified four components, which I call tempers, from which are derived every human soul. Woe. Frolic. Dread. Malice. Each man’s character is defined by the precise ratio that resides in him. I walked into the cave of my own mind, and there I tamed them. Should you tame the tempers as I did mine, then the world shall become but your appendage. It is this great and consecrated power that I hope to pass on to all of you, my children.",00:35:25
1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Myrtle Eagan (recording),"I think that to be an Eagan, either a true Eagan or anyone working in this Lumon family, what you are is the keeper of an ethos, a compact of values that we have long held as precious, and which I do believe will one day save this world.

1,3,In Perpetuity (Transcript),Irving,"It’s an unnatural state for a person to have no history. History makes us someone. Gives us a context. A shape. But waking up on that table, I was shapeless.

1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Milchick,"259. Again, please. Now.",00:02:32
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,What the hell is that voice?,00:02:40
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,“Forgive me for the harm I have caused this world. None may atone for my actions but me. And only in me shall their stain live on.”,00:02:59
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"I really am sorry, okay?",00:03:30
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,I’m sorry.,00:03:35
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Milchick,No paraphrasing. Again.,00:03:38
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,Mark?,00:06:35
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Yep?,00:06:35
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"It’s past 1100, and Helly’s been in the break room since yesterday.",00:06:36
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Okay?,00:06:41
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"I wonder if, as department chief,",00:06:41
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,you feel you should check on her progress?,00:06:43
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Well…,00:06:46
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,Mark doesn’t have that power.,00:06:46
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"Well, he can ask.",00:06:48
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,He’s not going to.,00:06:48
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,He might.,00:06:49
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Okay…,00:06:49
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,Hi. I’m so sorry to interrupt. We met the other day. I’m Burt from Optics and Design.,00:06:50
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,"Hi, Irving.",00:07:02
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"Hi, Burt. What are you doing here?",00:07:02
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,Exactly how the wet fuck do you know,00:07:05
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,where this office is?,00:07:07
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Dylan!,00:07:07
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,"My predecessor, Alice K., came here once when they still did the summits,",00:07:08
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,and she’d left directions.,00:07:12
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,Give us them reversed.,00:07:12
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,Okay. It’s all right.,00:07:15
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,"What can we do for you, Burt?",00:07:16
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,"Thank you. Well…Irving, I kept thinking about what you said about being excited for the new handbook totes, and maybe you were kidding and teasing.",00:07:17
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"No, not at all.",00:07:27
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,"Okay, good. I’ve been fretting, though, because you mentioned the anticipation could distract from your work, which was the opposite of my intent. So I figured, heck, let’s bring them over now. That way, it won’t be on your mind.",00:07:29
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,You brought pre-release handbook totes for us?,00:07:43
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,It seemed like the right thing. I know your time is valuable.,00:07:48
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,"Okay, well, you can drop ’em on the desk. Long hike back to O&D.",00:07:51
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,Right.,00:07:55
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,"I also wanted to extend an invitation. Again, I know you…you work hard, so… If an informal tour of O&D ever sounds refreshing, I’d be happy to personally offer that to Irving and any one of you.",00:07:56
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,"Directions are in the front bag, reversed.",00:08:11
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,Hard pass.,00:08:14
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,Okay.,00:08:18
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"Thank you, Burt.",00:08:21
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,Thank you.,00:08:23
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Just seems soon to be taking him up on his offer.,00:08:32
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,It’s absurd we’ve never visited them before now. Kier’s whole original vision saw us all working together.,00:08:35
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,That was before O&D started disemboweling people’s bowels.,00:08:43
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,Nonsense. I’ll be back by 1:00.,00:08:46
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,He’s gonna die.,00:08:50
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Irv…,00:08:54
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,How many times?,00:09:04
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"1,072.",00:09:08
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,What about the voice behind the door?,00:09:40
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,"Crying baby, you mean?",00:09:42
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"No. Like, the angry, mumbly guy.",00:09:45
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,"Guys? We’re really not supposed to talk about the break room. You know, the important thing is, you apologized correctly, and now you’re out.",00:09:47
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,"What you gotta do is trick the machine by thinking about something you’re really sorry about, so I like to imagine my Outie’s love-made with a MILF or two, which is obviously badass, but I do pity the husbands.",00:09:57
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Hey. Break room sucks. But that’s why we have protocols and procedures so we don’t end up there.,00:10:29
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,You’ll learn. I promise.,00:10:39
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,Hello?,00:10:54
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Felicia,Who’s that?,00:10:56
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,Hi. It’s Irving B. From Macrodata Refinement. We met in the hall the other day.,00:10:58
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Felicia,Burt’s over there by shelf six. Don’t touch anything.,00:11:09
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,"The big envelopes can handle an appendix reissue. But, of course, we ship all the hallway pieces in-frame.",00:11:16
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,So much to remember.,00:11:28
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,Felicia and I make do. I’m sure it’s easier than whatever you MDR kids get up to all day.,00:11:31
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"I can only imagine what it’s like when the new art comes in. I mean, you see it before anyone.",00:11:39
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"It’s so dumb, but I actually cried when you guys put up The Youthful Convalescence of Kier.",00:11:46
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,No.,00:11:54
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,I did.,00:11:54
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"I never thought I’d see the handbook passage depicted visually. It was only up for a month or so, but, man. What a month!",00:11:55
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,Come here.,00:12:11
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,"Once the hall art’s been cycled through all the departments, it ends up back here.",00:12:14
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,Wow!,00:12:21
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,Where did Felicia go?,00:12:26
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,Supply run.,00:12:27
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,Voilà.,00:12:32
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,"“Let not weakness live in your veins. Cherished workers, drown it inside you.”",00:12:39
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"“Rise up from your deathbed and sally forth, more perfect for the struggle.”",00:12:45
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Burt,Exactly.,00:12:54
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,I…I can’t believe you…you have this.,00:12:56
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,I’m sorry. What time is it? I have to go.,00:13:17
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,"Hey, Helly.",00:13:38
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,I got to 4%.,00:13:41
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Yes!,00:13:41
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,"Feels good, right?",00:13:43
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,I guess.,00:13:46
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Awesome. I’m glad you agree.,00:13:46
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Great work.,00:13:52
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,What’s this?,00:15:26
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,Will you put that away?,00:15:27
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,Put what away?,00:15:31
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,It’s a map of the hallways.,00:15:31
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,"No, it isn’t.",00:15:33
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,I thought we weren’t supposed to make maps.,00:15:34
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,We’re not. I didn’t. It’s just something I found. I think Petey made it.,00:15:37
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,"Oh, shit. You didn’t turn it in?",00:15:41
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"You’re such a hypocrite, lecturing me on following the rules.",00:15:44
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,I wasn’t lecturing you. I’m just trying to keep you out of the break room.,00:15:47
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,I can’t believe Petey was a mapper. Let me see it.,00:15:50
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,"He’s got Wellness, Management, Perpetuity… Everywhere we know of. This must’ve taken him weeks.",00:15:53
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,Why aren’t we supposed to map the office?,00:16:00
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,It’s an Eagan rule. “Render not my creation in miniature.”,00:16:02
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,Why?,00:16:05
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,What the fuck is this?,00:16:07
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"They look like houses, right? That’s how houses look.",00:16:09
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, exactly, because these are random, bored doodles.",00:16:11
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"Well, maybe they’re on the outside and Petey found a way to get to them.",00:16:15
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,So why would they be on a map of the severed floor?,00:16:17
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,It could be a thing. You don’t know.,00:16:20
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,It’s not a thing.,00:16:22
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,Clearly he was trying to tell you something.,00:16:23
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,No.,00:16:25
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"Go lick a boot, Mark.",00:16:26
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,You’re more loyal to this place than to your friend.,00:16:30
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,I’m loyal to how it felt around here before you showed up.,00:16:32
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,You mean when Petey was here?,00:16:36
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, because there was balance. We could have fun and work without the whole goddamn department imploding.",00:16:38
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,The work is bullshit.,00:16:44
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,"The work is mysterious and important. And we deal with the uncertainty it brings us in the way that Kier would’ve wanted. Together, as a family.",00:16:46
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"I could not, with a razor to my throat, be less interested in being your family.",00:17:00
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"Your best friend left this for you, and you don’t give a shit.",00:17:13
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,You’re right. I don’t give a shit.,00:17:34
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,Mark…,00:17:36
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,"There. It’s gone. Thank you, Helly. Now we can get back to work.",00:17:41
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,Mark! It’s an emergency.,00:17:50
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Okay. All right…,00:17:58
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"I was going to get Mr. Milchick, but I thought it best not to break the chain of command.",00:17:59
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,It’s just raining contraband today.,00:18:03
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,What do you mean?,00:18:05
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,It doesn’t matter.,00:18:05
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Has anyone seen anything like this before?,00:18:07
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"Passage 31, page 110. “Be content in my words, and dally not in the scholastic pursuits of lesser men.”",00:18:10
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,No books except the handbook. I know.,00:18:18
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,What are you doing?,00:18:22
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,His ego’s pissed ’cause Helly called him out for boot-licking.,00:18:23
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,My ego’s fine. I’m just trying to…,00:18:25
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,Damn.,00:18:25
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"Mark, what is this?",00:18:30
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,Maybe it’s another Petey message. Flip through. See if my name’s anywhere.,00:18:31
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,I bet it’s a loyalty test. Remember the spicy candy?,00:18:35
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,I’ll be turning this in to Milchick.,00:18:39
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,What? Why? It’s booty. It’s booty with your name on it.,00:18:41
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"Excellent decision, Mark. This is an idolatrous text that should be brought to him immediately.",00:18:44
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Dylan,"So, what’s their space like? Stalactites and shit?",00:19:15
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Irving,"No, it’s nice. Burt’s fostered a really welcoming environment. He understands the spirit of Lumon.",00:19:17
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Helly?,00:19:25
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Milchick,Excuse me! Helly!,00:19:28
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Cobel,"Jesus, Helly!",00:19:29
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,I want a camera!,00:19:30
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Milchick,"I am so sorry, Ms. Cobel. I will…",00:19:32
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Cobel,What is happening here?,00:19:32
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"What’s happening is, you’re going to give me a video camera so I can tape a resignation to my Outie right fucking now, or you’re going to have to explain to her why she’s missing four fingers.",00:19:35
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Cobel,Okay. Let’s just…,00:19:46
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"It’s Cobel, right?",00:19:50
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Cobel,Yes.,00:19:52
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"Cobel, do I look like I’m fucking around right now?",00:19:54
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Cobel,"No. No, you do not.",00:19:58
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,Helly!,00:20:01
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Cobel,"Hi, Mark. I’m just catching up with your trainee.",00:20:04
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Cobel,"Mr. Milchick, could you get the video camera, please?",00:20:11
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,Hey.,00:20:42
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"Well, boss. I guess this is the part where I should tell you to go to hell. Except you’re already here.",00:21:16
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,I was never sorry.,00:21:33
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"Helly, I watched your video asking that I resign. I also received and responded to your previous request. I assumed that would resolve the issue, but now Ms. Cobel says you threatened to cut off your fingers? I understand that you’re unhappy with the life that you’ve been given.",00:21:56
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"But you know what? Eventually, we all have to accept reality. So, here it is.",00:22:24
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,I am a person. You are not. I make the decisions. You do not.,00:22:33
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Helly,"And if you ever do anything to my fingers, know that I will keep you alive long enough to horribly regret that. Your resignation request is denied. Turn it off.",00:22:45

1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Devon,But it’s gonna be awesome. And you’re gonna like it.,00:23:40
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,"How much of this was Ricken’s idea, 300% or 400%?",00:23:42
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Devon,Just… Get all of your snark out now or you’re never gonna earn your uncle badge.,00:23:46
1,4,The You You Are (Transcript),Mark,You know what? I think I might have some more snark in me. I’m kinda tired.,00:23:50

1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Gabby,"Um, okay.",00:13:50
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Yeah? Yes. Thank you. Thank Christ.,00:13:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Hi. Thank you so much. I’m gonna squeeze right past you. Ooh. I’m Devon.,00:13:59
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Gabby,Gabby.,00:14:11
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Thank you for narcotics. My husband is driving me fucking crazy. My brother’s… depressing me.,00:14:12
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Gabby,Is it your first?,00:14:24
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Yeah. Yours?,00:14:26
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Gabby,My third. I’m naming him William.,00:14:28
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Three kiddos. I’m so fucking scared of ruining one child. How do you handle it?,00:14:32
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Gabby,"Lotta help, I guess.",00:14:39
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Yeah.,00:14:39
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,"Holy shit, by the way, how about this cabin? It’s so nice. Are you rich?",00:14:42
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ricken,"Because really…if the thief reads the book, it will have been worth it. In fact, I bet you he turns himself in afterward.",00:14:54
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ricken,"Listen, I know the last time you were in a medical facility was for Gemma.",00:15:05
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, is that what this is? A medical facility?",00:15:11
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ricken,"Of course, the baby’s middle name could’ve been so lovely a tribute to her, but…I understand you were unable to be comfortable with it.",00:15:16
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Your kid deserves her own name without some…big, feely baggage.",00:15:25
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Yes. Ooh.,00:15:40
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Psst. I got coffee.,00:15:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Toll, please.",00:15:58
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,"I made friends with the richest lady in baby camp. She was…quiet, but she was nice. Very cute. I should send you up there.",00:16:02
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,I’d imagine she’s spoken for.,00:16:14
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,I bet Alexa would give you another shot.,00:16:18
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,I bet she wouldn’t.,00:16:23
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,I bet you could ask her.,00:16:25
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Oh. Okay.,00:16:25
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Ah.,00:16:29
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,You okay? Do you want me to go get her?,00:16:29
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,"No, no, no. Hold on, can I squeeze your hand?",00:16:33
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. There we go. All right.,00:16:36
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Need me to tell a secret?,00:16:43
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,"Yeah, go ahead.",00:16:43
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Give me your dark shit.,00:16:46
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Well, so, uh…",00:16:47
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Um…I kinda think Lumon might be up to something.,00:16:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,"What do you mean? Like, with your paychecks?",00:17:05
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"No, I’ve just been hearing stuff. Just around.",00:17:08
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Who’ve you been talking to?,00:17:14
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,So… Um…,00:17:17
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,What?,00:17:23
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Do you remember the businessman?,00:17:26
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ricken,Oh.,00:17:29
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Holy fucking pit of hell!,00:17:32
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ricken,"Okay. Darling, you okay?",00:17:35
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Why do people do this?,00:17:37
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Uh, I’ll go get Alexa.",00:17:37
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ricken,Great.,00:17:39
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,"Don’t touch me, baby.",00:17:39
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ricken,Okay.,00:17:42
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Ah!,00:17:42
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Alexa,One more big push.,00:17:45
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ricken,"Oh, my God.",00:17:45
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Alexa,She’s right here. She’s right here. You’re doing so great.,00:17:47
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Ah!,00:17:47
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,It hurt… It hurts.,00:17:50
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Alexa,I know it hurts but she’s right here.,00:17:50
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Alexa,I can see her. She’s crowning. Okay?,00:17:54
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, my God.",00:17:54
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Alexa,"All right, now. You know, I can see her. Here she comes.",00:17:57
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, my God.",00:18:24
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Alexa,She’s coming.,00:18:24
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ricken,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",00:18:26
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Devon,Oh!,00:18:31
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ricken,"Thank you. Oh, she did great. I’m gonna pass out.",00:18:33
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,She was in Outie form at the time she woke up.,00:18:36
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,"So, this will be Innie Helly’s first conscious experience since the hanging.",00:18:39
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,"When she sees you, it’s important your eyes be kind.",00:18:46
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,Do you know how to make your eyes kind?,00:18:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Um…,00:18:58
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,You’re okay. You’re okay. It’s all right.,00:19:39
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"So, they locked away the extension cords and other dangerous items so, you know, you should be safe. And if you wanna focus on looking for happy numbers for a while, that’s fine.",00:19:58
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:20:22
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Do you wanna talk about it?,00:20:30
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,We should hide inspirational handbook quotes around the office for her to stumble upon.,00:20:46
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"She just needs to start earning perks, dude. I’d end my life if I didn’t have any finger traps yet. You know, what one of us should do is lend her our trap until she has one of her own. Yeah, but not me though ’cause I already contributed the idea. It’s only fair.",00:20:54
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Ms. Casey.,00:21:11
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,I’m here to observe Helly R.,00:21:14
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Oh. Uh, no one told me.",00:21:16
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"Ms. Cobel’s orders. I am to watch her for signs of sadness, and verbally encourage her to forgo further suicide attempts.",00:21:19
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"Upon request, I can also perform a hug.",00:21:27
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"You know I’ve been, uh, exhibiting signs of sadness. Could I get one of those?",00:21:31
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,No.,00:21:34
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,Did you get all that?,00:22:03
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Are you upset?,00:22:09
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,No. I’m peachy.,00:22:11
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"If you’re upset, you can request a…",00:22:17
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,A hug. I know. I’m good.,00:22:19
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Irv.,00:23:15
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"We lose you again there, buddy?",00:23:20
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Irv?,00:23:26
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,I have to go to O&D. Something’s come up. And I… I’d like to seek Burt’s counsel.,00:23:28
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Well… Okay, fine. Just make a copy of that map in case we have to come find you.",00:23:40
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"Oh, God.",00:24:12
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,"Oh, no. I’m sorry, Irving. We must have sent this print job here by mistake. You weren’t supposed to see this.",00:24:25
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,What are these?,00:24:32
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,Nothing. A joke for Ms. Cobel.,00:24:34
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"It’s the O&D coup, isn’t it? The one that Dylan talks about, huh? Did that actually happen, Mr. Milchick?",00:24:39
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,Of course not. Nothing like that could happen here.,00:24:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,It’s proof. It is ironclad proof.,00:25:00
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Milchick says it didn’t happen. And why would one department physically attack another? Lumon wouldn’t just then give them all the other department’s resources.,00:25:02
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"Does O&D know that? Are we even sure about it? Because with seven people, there is a lot that they could do to us.",00:25:10
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,I could ask…,00:25:18
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"Your new friend,",00:25:18
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,who lied to you about the size of his department? How do we know what else he isn’t being kosher about?,00:25:20
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,You ran a 266 on Irving B.?,00:25:39
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,Yeah. Just now.,00:25:44
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,Huh.,00:25:48
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,I thought it might dissuade him from spending so much time with Burt G.,00:25:51
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,I’m sorry. Should I have consulted you?,00:25:58
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,"No, no. Good initiative.",00:26:03
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,I saw Ms. Casey down there. You’re having her watch Helly R.,00:26:09
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,I am.,00:26:16
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,May I ask why?,00:26:18
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,“The light of discovery shines truer upon a virgin meadow than a beaten path.”,00:26:20
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,I’m trying something new with Ms. Casey. Keep it between us.,00:26:33
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Milchick,Right.,00:26:47
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Helly R.,00:27:37
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,"Hi, Ms. Casey.",00:27:39
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Please describe for me your time in the restroom.,00:27:42
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, no. I’m so sorry, Ms. Casey. I just… I-I… Ugh. I turned and…",00:27:45
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,Bet you’re drunk. What’d your mouth taste like when you got in today?,00:27:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"Helly R., you have to come with me to distribution supply.",00:27:57
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"That’s okay. I can watch Helly R. While you’re gone. It’s only a few minutes, right?",00:28:00
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"Distribution supply is eight minutes, round trip.",00:28:05
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"You know, I go to distribution supply all the time, so, I could, uh… If you…",00:28:21
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,"Well, that’s one less horrible thing. For eight minutes anyway.",00:28:28
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Helly, I just realized I haven’t shown you where we keep the extra pen caps. It’s not far. Do you mind?",00:28:35
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,"I’m good, thanks.",00:28:43
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Nah, you’re right. We shouldn’t go anywhere without Ms. Casey.",00:28:46
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"Careful out there, boss. Weird energy about.",00:28:58
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,"So, where are all these pen caps at?",00:29:31
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"How are you doing, Helly?",00:29:35
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,Jesus. Did you make up the pen caps to ask me that?,00:29:37
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Well, I just wanted to talk.",00:29:40
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,"I’m really bad, Mark. Thanks for noticing.",00:29:44
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Oh. Come here.,00:29:50
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Come on.,00:29:59
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Here.,00:30:14
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,Petey’s map.,00:30:18
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah. Since you’ve been gone, I’ve been trying to recreate it on my lunch breaks.",00:30:20
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"And…I thought maybe if we work on it together, we can… You know.",00:30:24
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,I’m not your new Petey.,00:30:33
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Helly.,00:30:47
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Helly R.?,00:30:51
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Mark took her to look at pen caps.,00:30:54
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Where?,00:30:54
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Now?,00:30:58
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,They’re fine.,00:30:58
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Just at the end of the storage wing.,00:30:59
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Burt G. Is in the conference room.,00:31:08
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Burt.,00:31:26
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Irving.,00:31:29
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,What are you doing here?,00:31:33
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"Oh. You know, I was turned around.",00:31:35
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"Actually, I…I was looking for you. I hadn’t heard from you.",00:31:40
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"Well, I…",00:31:51
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"Dylan! Oh, my God! What are…",00:31:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Irving.,00:31:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,What are you doing?,00:31:55
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,He was coming at you.,00:31:56
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Let him out!,00:31:56
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,Out? Why the fuck is he here?,00:31:57
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Let him out!,00:31:57
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,What’s wrong with you?,00:31:59
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,You saw that painting.,00:31:59
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,You want to get disemboweled today?,00:32:01
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"Hey, where’s your friends? Plural. As in, the six fucking people you’ve been hiding from us.",00:32:03
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"Oh, my word. I… I… I…",00:32:07
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,I need a manager!,00:32:09
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"Irving, wait. Don’t go.",00:32:11
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,I… We…,00:32:12
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,I know what you’re up to.,00:32:12
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,What is wrong with you? Open the door.,00:32:14
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Manager!,00:32:14
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Open the door.,00:32:17
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,We need a manager. We need a manager.,00:32:18
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Irving!,00:32:18
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Irving!,00:32:21
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Helly?,00:32:24
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Helly.,00:32:31
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,Helly.,00:32:35
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,Where the fuck are we?,00:32:39
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Look, don’t you want to at least…",00:32:43
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,"I told her I wanted out, and she told me I wasn’t a person. My own self told me that.",00:32:46
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, and… and that’s horrible. But don’t focus on her. What do you want? In here?",00:32:51
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,What I want is for her to wake up while the life drains out of her and to know it was me who did it.,00:33:01
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,If I could just explain…,00:33:19
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"Save it, marauder.",00:33:19
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,I checked the whole storage wing. No sign of him or Helly.,00:33:21
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,Shit. O&D has probably killed them already.,00:33:24
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"Irving, what?",00:33:26
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Our department chief and new hire have gone missing. Do you know where they are?,00:33:28
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"No, I j… I just came to see you.",00:33:33
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,And the rest of your department?,00:33:35
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"They’re back in O&D, Irving. I know I said it was just Felicia and me…",00:33:37
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"If you came here to see me, then why are you in the conference room? Why not come right to the office?",00:33:40
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"I didn’t know why you hadn’t been back, and I didn’t wanna scare you again. Like with the hand thing.",00:33:45
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,You didn’t scare me.,00:33:51
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"Or embarrass you. Look, I was working out a joke.",00:33:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,A joke?,00:33:56
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,To say when I got in.,00:33:56
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,Prove it. Tell it.,00:33:57
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,I hadn’t worked it out yet.,00:33:59
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Why did you lie about the number of people in your department?,00:34:03
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Because…we don’t trust your guys.,00:34:10
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,You? The king of fucks don’t trust us?,00:34:16
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,I do.,00:34:16
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"But people just talk about MDR. Stupid old stories, jokes even.",00:34:18
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,What do you mean?,00:34:24
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"I… It’s literally silly. Like, they say you all have pouches.",00:34:25
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Pouches? Like to c-carry young?,00:34:32
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Yes.,00:34:32
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"According to some, you each have a larval offspring that will jump out and attack if we get too close.",00:34:36
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,That’s fucking psycho.,00:34:43
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"I mean, it’s a joke of course, but I don’t know.",00:34:44
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"The sentiment, you know, somehow holds. People are weird.",00:34:47
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Yeah.,00:34:50
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"Though, I’d be remiss not to say",00:34:50
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"that in this theory, the larva eventually eats and replaces you.",00:34:53
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Oh.,00:35:00
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"Which, Irving, would solve the mystery…",00:35:00
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Of your youthful energy.,00:35:05
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Irv. Irv?,00:35:14
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Excuse me.,00:35:17
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Where are you going?,00:35:17
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Yes?,00:35:19
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,Are you sweet on this guy?,00:35:21
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,You disapprove?,00:35:25
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,I do. I do disapprove.,00:35:26
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"Uh, certainly the handbook forbids taking heart to other employees.",00:35:29
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"Rat-fuck the handbook. This guy’s O and goddamn D, who are duplicitous snakes to a one. It’s not safe.",00:35:32
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Goat Wrangler,They’re not ready. You can’t take them yet. They’re not ready. It isn’t time!,00:36:33
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,"Oh, we don’t…",00:36:44
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Goat Wrangler,Get the hell out of here.,00:36:44
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Goat Wrangler,Go!,00:36:47
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,“The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design”?,00:36:55
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,That’s what it said. Mm-hmm.,00:36:58
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,There’s definitely no painting by that name. What kind of barbarities were we enacting?,00:37:01
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"It doesn’t matter. I don’t think it was real. I mean, I’ll have to confer with my larva, of course.",00:37:06
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,I’m… I’m sorry you had to do this.,00:37:17
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,It’s all right.,00:37:17
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"I mean, you know that relationships beyond the, uh, platonic are frowned upon anyway.",00:37:23
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Is that what we are?,00:37:33
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"Well, uh, Burt G., at this time I, uh, formally release you from MDR’s supervision.",00:37:38
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"As Kier said, “Be ever merry.”",00:37:49
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"Would you like to come in? There is something in the storeroom I’d like to show you. And Dylan, of course.",00:37:55
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,The Courtship of Kier and Imogen.,00:38:10
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,He met his wife while a stewman in an ether factory.,00:38:14
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,Damn dumb being here.,00:38:20
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,She was a swab girl.,00:38:23
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,The handbook just says they were bonded by the spirit of industry.,00:38:25
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"I know, but if this interpretation is correct…",00:38:30
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,they met as colleagues. Took heart to each other as colleagues.,00:38:34
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,Mmm.,00:38:38
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Hmm.,00:38:38
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Makes you wonder how something could be wrong if Kier…,00:38:47
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,Get away from him! You lying fuck!,00:38:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"Dylan, what?",00:38:52
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Dylan!,00:38:55
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,He claims he doesn’t know,00:38:55
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"about this painting, meanwhile, it’s sitting on his shelf.",00:38:56
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,That isn’t.,00:38:59
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"Irv, we need to go. Now.",00:38:59
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,It’s not the same.,00:39:02
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,What?,00:39:04
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,Look.,00:39:04
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Irving,"Look at the badges the raiders are wearing. That’s not O&D, Dylan. It’s us.",00:39:05
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,This one’s never gone into the hallway rotation. It’s called The Macrodata Refinement Calamity.,00:39:13
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,"Okay, but we’ve never done anything like that.",00:39:19
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Dylan,Why the hell would there be two versions of the same painting?,00:39:21
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,"I mean, what if the goats are the numbers? Like, we’re deciding which goats live and which ones… Oh, God.",00:39:37
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,I doubt it’s that.,00:39:43
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Look, um… I know you don’t wanna be here. But…I’m glad you are.",00:39:44
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,And I’m sorry that this is the best I can do right now.,00:39:55
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,"If you give me the map, I’ll clean it up. Your drawing is shit.",00:40:03
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,"Oh. Hi, uh, Ms. Casey. We were just heading back from our mental health walk.",00:40:15
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,You’re both unhurt?,00:40:21
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Helly,We… We are.,00:40:24
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,I’m glad. I was scared.,00:40:26
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Mark,I’m sorry.,00:40:30
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,I forgive you.,00:40:33
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"Okay, then.",00:40:38
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Graner,You aware what MDR is up to right now?,00:40:59
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,I thought that’s what you were paid for.,00:41:02
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Graner,You’re not stopping it?,00:41:05
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,“The surest way to tame a prisoner is to let him believe he’s free.”,00:41:07
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Graner,There’s a Kier quote for everything.,00:41:12
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Graner,How many more departments are you gonna let them find?,00:41:14
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,I’ll have a word with Mark.,00:41:16
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Graner,I would be careful. Upstairs wouldn’t look kindly on this.,00:41:18
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,"Yes, Daddy.",00:41:23
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Cobel,You can talk to me when you figure out who hacked Kilmer’s chip.,00:41:27
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,"Excuse me, everyone. I wanna introduce you all to Irving and Dylan.",00:41:41
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,They’re from MDR.,00:41:49
1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design (Transcript),Burt,And they’re friends.,00:41:53
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Graner.,00:00:51
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,We ran the data from Kilmer’s head like you asked. We found the signature from the console they used to hack the chip.,00:00:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Whose was it?,00:00:57
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,Ours. I think it’s traceable to Reghabi.,00:00:59
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Reghabi.,00:01:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,Yep.,00:01:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,She cracked reintegration. I’ll find her.,00:01:04
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,“Tame in me the tempers four that I may serve thee evermore. Place in me the values nine that I may feel thy touch divine.”,00:01:32
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,Can I come in?,00:04:54
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,Yeah. Yeah.,00:04:56
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,You found this?,00:05:07
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,"A while back. I come here sometimes, just me. Now, I want to show it to you.",00:05:10
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,It’s beautiful.,00:05:25
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,It could be just for us. Our secret place.,00:05:29
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,Finally.,00:05:35
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,"What I mean to say is that your O&D colleagues are very nice, but they’re also…",00:05:37
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,Always around.,00:05:43
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,Yes.,00:05:43
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,Is this okay?,00:05:53
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,"Irving, you know, the Lumon manual doesn’t say anything about lip-to-lip contact.",00:05:58
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,"It does discourage romantic fraternization, though.",00:06:05
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,This can’t be romantic then.,00:06:10
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,No.,00:06:14
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,Not romantic… at all?,00:06:17
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,I’m truly sorry… I’m just not ready.,00:06:25
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,I’m… I’m sorry.,00:06:34
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,It’s fine.,00:06:41
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,Just stay. Stay here with me.,00:06:45
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,You did so good. Now we’re gonna go home and see if you’ll eat. Please.,00:07:13
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Looks like we both made it through.,00:07:45
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Gabby,"Oh, hello.",00:07:47
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Hi.,00:07:47
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Devon. From the retreat. I accosted you for your coffee.,00:07:50
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,He’s beautiful. He looks like a William.,00:07:56
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Gabby,"His name’s Bradley, actually.",00:08:00
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Not William?,00:08:04
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,You changed it?,00:08:06
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Angelo,Did we leave the juice boxes in the car?,00:08:06
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Gabby,"We must have, yeah.",00:08:10
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Angelo,Hi. Angelo Arteta.,00:08:12
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,I’m Devon. Nice to meet you.,00:08:15
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Angelo,Congratulations there.,00:08:17
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, thank you.",00:08:17
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Angelo,You two know each other?,00:08:19
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,"Yeah, I was… We were… Met at the birthing cottages.",00:08:21
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Angelo,"Nice to meet you too, Devon.",00:08:26
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Yeah. You too.,00:08:26
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Wow-kazow.,00:08:32
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Angelo,We should go.,00:08:35
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Gabby,Bye. Bye.,00:08:38
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,"Bye, you guys.",00:08:38
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,"Bye, Bradley.",00:08:41
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Angelo,"Declan, Kai, come on.",00:08:45
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,What in the fuckity fuck?,00:08:48
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Sorry.,00:08:51
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken (voiceover),"What does camaraderie mean? Most linguists agree it comes from the Latin “camera,” which means “a device used to take a photograph.” And of course, the best photographs are of groups of happy friends who love each other deeply.",00:08:55
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken (voiceover),But I think camaraderie is more than smiling together in photos. It’s standing together in hard times. It’s recognizing a common struggle in another person and reaching out to offer them a loving hand.,00:09:14
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,We should return to O&D immediately. All of us. Today.,00:09:36
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Someone’s eager to fraternize.,00:09:41
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,Fraternization has nothing to do with it. This could be the start of us uniting the departments the way Kier always intended.,00:09:43
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Maybe his ghost can officiate your wedding.,00:09:50
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,This is inappropriate workplace commentary. And I’m self-reporting you.,00:09:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,You’re reporting me to yourself?,00:09:55
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Okay. You said they were making things?,00:09:58
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,"Yes, in some kind of machines. We didn’t ask what.",00:10:00
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,It’s the clubs they murder those goats with.,00:10:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,Shut up.,00:10:04
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,I agree with Irving. O&D is the next piece of this.,00:10:05
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,"Now, once we’ve mapped the whole floor…",00:10:08
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,"To be clear, I do not approve of mapping.",00:10:08
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,Right.,00:10:12
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,What if we go on another “mental health walk”? Could be fun.,00:10:13
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"What… I don’t know. I mean, we still have a lot of work to do, so…",00:10:19
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,"Oh, right.",00:10:24
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,The work is mysterious and important.,00:10:27
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,That’s good. That sounds just like me.,00:10:32
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,I know.,00:10:35
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,"Back to work, slackers.",00:10:38
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,Praise Kier.,00:10:44
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Hey. Are you fraternizing too?,00:10:47
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"What? No, I…",00:10:50
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,I’m a leader who cares about his employees and takes their requests seriously.,00:10:53
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Really?,00:10:58
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:10:58
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Look at you all dewy mouthed.,00:11:00
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,You never smile at me.,00:11:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,"He’s right, Mark.",00:11:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,You are sparing with the facial encouragements.,00:11:04
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,That’s ridiculous. I smile all the time.,00:11:08
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,Hey there. What are you all talking about?,00:11:10
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,Just…,00:11:15
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,We’re…,00:11:16
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,Dis…,00:11:16
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Discussing the…,00:11:18
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,"Yes, Mrs…",00:11:18
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Ms. Casey. Ms. Casey.,00:11:20
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,Ms. Casey. Yeah.,00:11:20
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Wait, where is she?",00:11:24
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"Part-time Innies may not be as socialized and sophisticated as yourself, but they still must be held accountable for their actions.",00:11:28
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"Ms. Casey was told to supervise Helly, and she failed at that task.",00:11:38
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Because I snuck Helly out. I mean, if anyone should be in the break room, it’s me.",00:11:44
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"Valiance. Not a core principle, but sweet.",00:11:51
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Who won’t you go to the break room for?,00:11:57
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"She’s just a wellness counselor, Mark.",00:12:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Yes, but she shouldn’t be punished.",00:12:06
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"I mean, I thought Helly needed a walk. I mean, I’m allowed to do that.",00:12:07
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Just a walk?,00:12:11
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:12:13
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Or were you sniffing around other departments while your department falls woefully below quota?,00:12:20
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,She almost died.,00:12:26
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,It’s not your job to play nursemaid to every new refiner.,00:12:28
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, so what is my job?",00:12:33
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Are you really asking me that?,00:12:36
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. What is it we actually do here?,00:12:39
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"We serve Kier, you child!",00:12:45
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"And until you get that through your mildewed little brain and hit quota, MDR’s hallway privileges are hereby revoked. So get your little ass back to your desk and stay there until you’re told to move.",00:12:48
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Goddamn tragedy for the ages.,00:13:12
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,MDR will mourn the “will-they-won’t-they” energy shared by Ms. Casey and myself.,00:13:14
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,"Oh, yeah?",00:13:18
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,And to think I wore this nice-ass shirt for her today.,00:13:19
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,"When you picked that shirt, you didn’t know she existed.",00:13:23
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,"Well, maybe love transcends severance.",00:13:25
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,You think so?,00:13:28
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,No.,00:13:28
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,What about you and Mark?,00:13:32
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:13:34
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,You two enjoy sneaking off the other day? “Baby goats”?,00:13:35
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,Why are you saying it like that?,00:13:41
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,Are you implying that “baby goats” is code for sex with Mark S.?,00:13:45
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,Wow.,00:13:51
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Is “baby goats” code for sex with Mark S.?,00:13:53
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,"No, they were actual goats. Why would we call it that?",00:13:56
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,"Okay. Yeah, I believe you.",00:14:00
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,Mark.,00:14:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,You find out what happened?,00:14:05
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,She’s in the break room.,00:14:07
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,Shit. Is that because of us?,00:14:09
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"And we’re not allowed in the outer hallways anymore till we hit quota, so no more interdepartmental visits!",00:14:14
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Are you serious?,00:14:23
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,"I’m…I’m sorry, Mark. It’s… It’s my fault… That I’ve been setting a bad example as the senior-most refiner.",00:14:30
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Which way did you say it was to O&D?,00:14:48
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Milchick!,00:15:13
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,I’m on it.,00:15:15
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,This is more people than I’ve ever seen.,00:15:50
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Same.,00:15:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,"It’s okay. I know change can be disorienting, but MDR is here now.",00:15:56
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,"You are welcome here, much as I hope all of us will be welcome to visit you at your place of endeavors.",00:16:07
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,Now go on. Surely you must have some questions for them.,00:16:14
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Elizabeth,"So, it’s called Macrodata Refinement? What do you refine?",00:16:24
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,Is that a watering can?,00:16:36
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,We think it might be supplies for the executive wing upstairs.,00:16:40
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,"Then again, last week’s output had more of an aggressive feel.",00:16:45
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Elizabeth,The hatchets weren’t aggressive.,00:16:49
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,Hatchets?,00:16:51
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,We’ve been trying to figure out how it all fits together.,00:16:54
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"We found a department the opposite way from here that’s, well, raising baby goats.",00:16:57
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,Raising baby goats?,00:17:06
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,"There is a lot unknown to us as well, but we keep plugging along. It’s important work, obviously.",00:17:12
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,Everything we do here is important.,00:17:19
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Helly,It’s important because it actually is or because you’re saying it is?,00:17:24
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Look, maybe we should work together on this.",00:17:30
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Felicia,"Together doing what, exactly?",00:17:35
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"I don’t know. Finding out why there are goats. Or, you know, finding out how big this place is or how many of us there are.",00:17:39
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"I mean, why won’t they tell us what we’re doing here? What-What are they so afraid of?",00:17:54
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,If the Eagan philosophy is illumination above all…,00:18:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,Illumination beyond all. But yes.,00:18:06
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Then why doesn’t that include us?,00:18:10
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Why are we down here still working in the dark?,00:18:13
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,"That was poetic as shit, man.",00:18:25
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Thanks.,00:18:27
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,Mark is right.,00:18:31
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Irving,He is?,00:18:32
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,He is.,00:18:32
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,"Irving, Kier would want us to feel the warm embrace of knowledge and truth. That way we could be true partners in his teachings.",00:18:34
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Exactly.,00:18:44
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Burt,"I think, as the two department chiefs, Mark and I should make contact with this goat department, see what they know. And we can each bring one aide-de-camp.",00:18:46
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"We’re not children, Mr. Milchick. We didn’t do anything wrong.",00:19:24
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel (singing),"Kier, chosen one, Kier.",00:19:50
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"I trusted you, and you abused that trust. Your inefficiency and free-range chicken roaming is ultimately your responsibility.",00:20:27
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Escort him to the break room.,00:20:47
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,I’m sorry.,00:22:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,What happened to your hand?,00:22:22
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Apparently, I jammed my hand at work replenishing a watercooler. Or at least that’s what they tell me.",00:22:26
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,Those jugs are very heavy.,00:22:32
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Indeed they are.,00:22:34
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Waiter,Another merlot?,00:22:35
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,"I’m fine, thanks.",00:22:36
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"I’m good with water, thank you.",00:22:38
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Have you seen the princess?,00:22:42
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,"No, not since her birth. But I did talk on the phone with your sister.",00:22:45
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,I don’t know how much she tells you about her…,00:22:50
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Latching difficulties?,00:22:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,Yes.,00:22:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,I-I’m aware. Maybe too aware. I don’t know.,00:22:54
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,"Well, she just wanted the names of some lactation consultants.",00:22:56
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Well, it’s not something serious, is it?",00:23:01
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,No. It’s very common.,00:23:03
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Still, it’s probably good to get an expert opinion. I mean, from someone other than…",00:23:05
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,Ricken? Yes.,00:23:09
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,…Ricken.,00:23:09
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,Did you ever think about having kids?,00:23:13
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,With Gemma?,00:23:18
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,Yes.,00:23:20
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, we tried for a little while. It wasn’t really working.",00:23:27
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"We talked about adopting at one point, but…I don’t know. Then you think, “Okay, this is the life you’ve been given. And, um, that’s another life, and you don’t get that one. So do something with this.”",00:23:32
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,That’s very healthy.,00:23:50
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Well, it’s mostly stuff she said. She was very pragmatic. Always had a plan B.",00:23:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"You know, one time we were supposed to go on this camping trip and… Is it weird that I’m talking about her right now?",00:24:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,I feel like…,00:24:08
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,"No, I think it’s also healthy.",00:24:08
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, but we’re on a date. I…",00:24:11
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,I haven’t walked out on you yet.,00:24:14
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"You know, sometimes I think…she’d want me to get off my ass. And sometimes I think she’s not worried about me at all. She’s just pissed that she’s dead.",00:24:23
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Sorry, I know this doesn’t totally make sense.",00:24:37
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,She’s a part of you. You know? You can’t just separate yourself…,00:24:41
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, no, but you can, Alexa.",00:24:46
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,"Oh, shit.",00:24:46
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,With this exciting new procedure.,00:24:50
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,Walked right into that.,00:24:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Yes, you did.",00:24:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken,Love?,00:25:40
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Yeah?,00:25:40
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken,She’s here.,00:25:43
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Yeah.,00:25:43
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken,Careful. Watch your step. Right this way.,00:25:49
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Love it.,00:25:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Okay. My girl. There’s my girl.,00:25:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken,Okay.,00:25:59
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,You must be Devon.,00:26:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken,"Devon, this is Mrs. Selvig.",00:26:04
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,"Hi. Yeah, and you’re Mark’s neighbor. Thanks so much for meeting with us.",00:26:06
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"Oh, it’s a privilege. I went giddy when Mark mentioned you were looking for someone.",00:26:09
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken,So serendipitous.,00:26:13
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,I know.,00:26:13
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken,"The kelp worked, huh?",00:26:16
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"And this must be little Eleanor. Hello, little Eleanor.",00:26:18
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"You had a vaginal birth, yes?",00:26:26
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, yeah.",00:26:26
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,We should talk about different nursing positions.,00:26:28
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"Oh, and I brought you this. Shea butter salve for your nipples. It’s on the house.",00:26:30
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken,We are talking to a few candidates.,00:26:37
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Of course.,00:26:37
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, here we go.",00:26:39
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,Sorry. Sorry.,00:26:41
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Ricken,Yeah.,00:26:41
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"Oh, no, don’t be sorry. That’s what babies do. May I?",00:26:43
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Devon,"Yeah, yeah.",00:26:48
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"Darling. There, there, there. Okay.",00:26:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan’s son,"…seventy hundred one, seventy hundred two, seventy hundred forty-three, seventy hundred forty-six, seventy hundred forty-eight…",00:27:25
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,Dylan. I’ve awoken you at home. I need to know where you put it.,00:27:42
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Where I put what?,00:27:48
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,The ideographic card you took from O&D.,00:27:50
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,I saw the footage of you taking it. Did you smuggle it out? Is it here?,00:27:51
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,"Holy shit, is this my house?",00:27:55
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,"Dylan, listen. You have no idea how sensitive this information is. If someone paid you to smuggle out that card…",00:27:57
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,"No, no. I just… I put it in the bathroom. Second stall, behind the toilet.",00:28:04
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,Thank you.,00:28:08
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,I didn’t even know what it was.,00:28:09
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,That’s fine too.,00:28:10
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan’s son,Daddy.,00:28:10
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan’s son,Daddy.,00:28:13
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Wh… What the fuck?,00:28:14
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,We told you to count to a thousand and wait outside.,00:28:16
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,Is that my kid?,00:28:20
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,End it.,00:28:22
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan’s son,Daddy.,00:28:29
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Dylan,We good here?,00:28:35
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Milchick,We’re good.,00:28:37

1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,Yeah.,00:28:55
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, wow. That’s June.",00:29:02
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Hey, this is tonight. Like, right now. Should… Should we go to this, maybe?",00:29:09
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,What is it?,00:29:16
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Well, it’s this band. I… I kind of know one of them. If it’s lame, we’ll leave.",00:29:18
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,You mean if it isn’t as cool as we are.,00:29:25
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Exactly.,00:29:29
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,I am feeling very old right now.,00:29:40
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,"No, you totally fit in. Don’t worry about it.",00:29:44
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Hi. Two beers, please.",00:29:56
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Hello. Thank you.,00:30:04
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Lead Singer,"Hi. Who’s doing sound in this alleyway tonight? It’s terrible. All right, let’s get this over with.",00:30:11
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Lead Singer (singing),Summer rain As I work these days,00:30:30
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Guy at Venue,"No filming, you fuck.",00:30:43
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Sure, thank you.",00:30:44
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Lead Singer (singing),You can make this all come true,00:30:45
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),June,"Fuck you, Lumon!",00:31:06
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Lead Singer (singing),"Fuck you, Lumon You took my first love",00:31:13

1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark (singing),"Fuck you, Lumon! I hate you, Lumon!",00:31:25
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Alexa,What’s happening? This is depraved.,00:31:29

1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),June,Are we? I’m pretty sure we suck.,00:31:56
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Well, that last song was great.",00:31:59
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),June,"Write what you know, right?",00:32:02

1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:32:09
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),June,How the fuck would you even know that?,00:32:11
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Guy at Venue,"Hey, fuck you, man.",00:32:13
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,I think we’re gonna take off.,00:32:19

1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,Harmony.,00:33:07
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,Did you find her?,00:33:09
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,I got a tip from a campus cop at Ganz College. She… What the fuck are you wearing?,00:33:10
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,I was doing some private research.,00:33:17
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,What’s that a euphemism for?,00:33:21
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"Doug, I’ve had a day. And I’m still trying to figure out what part of this conversation couldn’t have happened on the phone.",00:33:24
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,Someone’s holed up in one of Ganz’s old lab buildings. The dean’s told security to look the other way. Probably is Reghabi.,00:33:34
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,It is her.,00:33:42
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,Wanna come with me and find out?,00:33:44
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Cobel,"No, I do not. Let me know when you have her.",00:33:47
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,"Oh, maintenance is installing tonight. I think it’s a good call.",00:33:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Graner,"So, you’re like a nurse or something?",00:33:59
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Hello?,00:35:16
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Reghabi,Who is this?,00:35:18
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,A friend of Petey’s.,00:35:26
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Hello? Are… Are you there?,00:35:35
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Reghabi,Is this Mark Scout?,00:35:41
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Reghabi,What did he tell you before he died?,00:35:48
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Nothing.,00:35:52
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,I just…I-I-I… I wanna…I wanna understand.,00:35:53
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Reghabi,Can you meet me now?,00:36:06
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Reghabi,Are you alone?,00:38:08
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, it’s just me.",00:38:16
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,I used to teach at this school.,00:38:22
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Reghabi,I know.,00:38:24
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Mark,Who are you?,00:38:29
1,6,Hide and Seek (Transcript),Reghabi,Come with me.,00:38:36
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Who are you?,00:00:12
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,Come with me.,00:00:16
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,You could’ve thrown away Petey’s phone weeks ago. Why didn’t you?,00:01:11
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"I’m sorry, just… Who are you?",00:01:15
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,I’m the one who helped your friend.,00:01:17
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Helped? You mean reintegration? It killed him.,00:01:20
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,The procedure didn’t kill Petey. If he had followed my post-op instructions and not simply run away at the first sign of sickness…,00:01:23
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"So, you… You’re a doctor?",00:01:29
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"I put that chip in your head, and I’m still the only one who can deactivate it.",00:01:33
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Maybe I don’t want it deactivated.,00:01:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"Right. Well, maybe your Innie does.",00:01:49
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"You wonder what he thinks about all this, don’t you? You wonder if he’s happy?",00:01:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"I hate that term, “Innie.” So infantilizing.",00:01:57
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"Then again, you’ve been severed for two years, right? So your Innie really is still just a baby.",00:02:01
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"My Innie lives his own life and, as a result, I get to live mine.",00:02:08
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"But he only exists because of you. And for all intents and purposes, he is you.",00:02:15
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"Do you really think he’s different down there? Combs his hair differently, laughs at different jokes?",00:02:23
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"Maybe he loves it, you’re right. But maybe he doesn’t. Maybe he dreams every day about clawing his way to the surface.",00:02:30
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,But you wouldn’t know. You’ll never know.,00:02:42
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"You brought him into this world without his permission, based on your own desire for emotional convenience.",00:02:49
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,I’m not a bad person.,00:03:01
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,I think you wanna do what’s right. Both of you.,00:03:04
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Graner,Mr. Scout.,00:03:14
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Do I know you?,00:03:19
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Graner,We work together. Down there.,00:03:21
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Graner,"You having a chat with someone, Mark?",00:03:28
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Graner,It’s okay. I’m a friend.,00:03:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Shit! What the fuck are you doing?,00:03:38
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,Grab his arms.,00:03:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,What?,00:03:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,Come here. His arms.,00:03:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, fuck! Oh, my God. Fuck. Oh, God.",00:03:54
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,I work with him.,00:04:07
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Graner,"No, you don’t.",00:04:08
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,He’s Doug Graner. Head of security on the severed floor.,00:04:11
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Security? Oh, my God.",00:04:15
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, I’m gonna get sick. I need to throw up.",00:04:18
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,I’m gonna throw up right now.,00:04:20
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,Don’t! Don’t! Don’t!,00:04:20
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,Your DNA’s in that!,00:04:24
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"Look, Graner’s security card. Full access, and it can’t be tied to anyone. Take it to work tomorrow. He’ll know what to do.",00:04:30
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Who’ll know what to do?,00:04:40
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,You.,00:04:41
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,Give me the phone. Petey’s phone. Give it to me. I’ll take care of this.,00:04:43
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"Go home, get rid of your clothes. Go now.",00:04:51
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,"I’ll be in touch. It’s gonna be okay. We’ll finish what Petey started, Mark.",00:05:03
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Reghabi,Now get the fuck out of here!,00:05:10
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, hey.",00:08:09
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Alexa,Hey.,00:08:09
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Just getting some water. Do you need anything?,00:08:10
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Alexa,Where were you?,00:08:13
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Who, me?",00:08:15
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Alexa,Yeah.,00:08:17
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Just…,00:08:17
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Alexa,I heard the car.,00:08:19
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,You heard a car?,00:08:22
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Alexa,You’re being weird.,00:08:32
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Maybe it was just a dream.,00:08:36
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Alexa,"I’ve been up for an hour, and you weren’t here.",00:08:41
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, just…",00:08:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"I’m sorry, I…I just needed to drive a little.",00:08:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Alexa,Are you okay?,00:09:01
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Well, I mean, this is kind of a big deal for me. And…I don’t know. It’s…",00:09:07
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Alexa,Do you want me to go?,00:09:22
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Maybe. Maybe.,00:09:27
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Fucking shit.,00:10:24
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,Mark!,00:10:28
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Hey.,00:10:30
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,You’re out early in all this snowiness.,00:10:30
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,You usually dispose of your waste in the early afternoon.,00:10:33
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, well, just getting a head start on the day, I guess.",00:10:38
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"You look troubled, Mark. Maybe we should talk later over a nice hot cup of lavender tea?",00:10:44
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah. I’m just gonna see how the day goes, you know?",00:10:54
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,Jack Frost certainly needs some new dandruff shampoo.,00:10:59
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Burt G.,00:12:29
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"Mr. Milchick. Pleasure to see you, sir.",00:12:31
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,So early.,00:12:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Please, sit.",00:12:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,Thank you.,00:12:36
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,I have something for you.,00:12:38
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"The missing 7199-G. Oswald will be so delighted. I, too, am delighted.",00:12:40
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Oh, good. Now we can focus on the final preparations.",00:12:47
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,That we can.,00:12:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Without interruptions.,00:12:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,That we shall.,00:12:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Excellent.,00:12:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,May I?,00:12:58
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"Yes, of course.",00:12:58
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Outstanding.,00:13:06
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,Yep.,00:13:07
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Wow.,00:13:07
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"You’ve been a great leader to this department, Burt G.",00:13:10
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,Thank you.,00:13:12
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,You deserve something special.,00:13:13
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"Not… Not a trip to the break room, I hope. Yesterday was quite enough.",00:13:16
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"No. No, not that. Something else. Stay tuned.",00:13:25
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Dylan G. Good morning.,00:13:38
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,What the hell was that?,00:13:42
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Walk with me.,00:13:44
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,What happened last night is called the Overtime Contingency. It’s a safeguard we occasionally employ to remotely awaken workers off-site.,00:13:49
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,You never told us you could do that.,00:13:57
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,It’s for emergency use only. And I didn’t consult Ms. Cobel because she’s been so stressed.,00:13:59
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,The boy. Was he… Was that my son?,00:14:05
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"He’d agreed to count to a thousand, which he then violated.",00:14:12
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"I really wouldn’t mention this to your colleagues, Dylan. This OTC’s pretty need-to-know. Understand?",00:14:18
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,Can you tell me his name?,00:14:31
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Not knowing is probably for the best.,00:14:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Hey, I know this has been a tough quarter. I’m gonna see about rustling you up some special perks. That sound good?",00:14:41
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,"Good man, Dylan. Good man.",00:14:55
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Mark S. Good morning.,00:15:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Good morning.,00:15:56
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"So, am I going to the…",00:16:02
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,I’m here to escort you to your desk.,00:16:03
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,New protocol.,00:16:06
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Sounds good.,00:16:09
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Lead the way.,00:16:11
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Wait, we’re locked in now?",00:16:55
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"I prefer the phrase, “safely situated.”",00:16:56
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,These doors help us to ensure you all are tucked nicely in your work spaces.,00:17:00
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Did Mr. Graner order this?,00:17:04
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Mark S. Is here.,00:17:08
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Have a seat.,00:17:10
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,I…,00:17:11
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Coffee. Black. I’ll bring it to you.,00:17:11
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,"Good morning, Mark.",00:17:15
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,Morning.,00:17:17
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Morning.,00:17:17
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,"Mark, what is this?",00:17:20
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"How’re you doing, Irv?",00:17:26
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,"I’m well, thank you. I… The renovations are…very nice.",00:17:27
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah. Dylan, you all right?",00:17:33
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,I’m fine.,00:17:36
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"That’s the best you can do? Where’s the sly, profanity-laced comeback?",00:17:38
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Here you go. Straight from the hills of Rwanda.,00:17:44
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Thanks.,00:17:51
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Hey, it’s me. Don’t know if you heard, but Graner didn’t come in. Everything’s fine, just wondering where you are.",00:17:57
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"So I lean my upper body slightly forward, while cradling the top of the neck, just so. Exhale softly. Just a whisper of a breeze. Then I do this, and this. Show the baby the areola, and we latch. Now you try.",00:18:06
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,All right.,00:18:33
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,"You ready? You ready, buddy?",00:18:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,Okay.,00:18:38
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"Yeah, expose the areola. Let her see it.",00:18:40
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,Okay.,00:18:40
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,She’s…,00:18:44
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,There she is.,00:18:44
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"Yes, Eleanor, yes! Yes.",00:18:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, my God.",00:18:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"Baby sips, baby sips.",00:18:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"So she goes into the airport restroom to try to hand express. She gets into the stall, and she’s trying to do it in the toilet paper, but it’s just flying everywhere.",00:18:59
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"Yes, like an angry fire hose.",00:19:14
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, no!",00:19:14
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,Stop.,00:19:19
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, God. Thank you for helping me.",00:19:21
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,Did you say you need to get to the store?,00:19:27
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,They can do without me. I’m having fun.,00:19:30
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"Besides, it’s not as if you have a fleet of nannies and manservants coming to take care of you, do you?",00:19:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,Nope.,00:19:40
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,I met this rich woman at the birthing retreat. I guess her husband’s a state senator.,00:19:45
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"Oh, wow.",00:19:51
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,"I know, but it was weird ’cause I saw her again at the park a few days later, and she 100% didn’t remember me.",00:19:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,What a snoot.,00:19:59
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,Yeah. Like… I don’t know. This is stupid.,00:20:01
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,"Mark’s company, Lumon, they say that they only sever people for work. But I was thinking, what if someone… Like, what if you wanted a baby, but you didn’t wanna…",00:20:11
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,I don’t know.,00:20:26
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"Well, I don’t think I’d remember even Clark Gable if I’d just given birth, so…",00:20:30
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,Yeah.,00:20:37
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,Severed. Why do you think Mark did it?,00:20:43
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,"Well, it was right after he lost his wife. At first, he tried to keep teaching at the college, but he couldn’t.",00:20:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,Does he ever talk about her?,00:21:02
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Devon,Not as much as I’d wish.,00:21:04
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,"When my husband passed, I thought I saw him everywhere. It was just so hard.",00:21:07
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,Does Mark ever think he sees her?,00:21:15
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,Hey.,00:21:31
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Hey.,00:21:33
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,I was just in the bathroom.,00:21:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Yeah?,00:21:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,"Yeah. Hey, what ever happened to the soap labels?",00:21:36
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,The soap labels?,00:21:41
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,Yeah.,00:21:41
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,"Shouldn’t there be labels on the soap dispensers saying, “soap”?",00:21:43
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,There’s never been that.,00:21:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,We all know it’s soap.,00:21:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,Seems like an O&D question.,00:21:53
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Irv, you know we can’t go anywhere. I mean, I get that you’re worried about Burt.",00:21:56
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,Suppose he’s being disciplined for our visit?,00:22:03
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,"Suppose he is, thanks to you. If only someone had told you that going there was a shitty fucking idea from the jump.",00:22:07
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Good day, Refiners!",00:22:17
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,What’s this?,00:22:20
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,It’s an MDE.,00:22:23
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,She got to 75%?,00:22:25
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Helly R., please step forward.",00:22:32
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,MDE?,00:22:36
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"By reaching 75% refinement on Siena, you have earned for you and your fellow refiners a five-minute Music/Dance Experience.",00:22:38
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,"Mr. Milchick, she’s at 73%.",00:22:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Yes, well, it’s been a tough morning on all of us.",00:22:54
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,Why for you?,00:22:56
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,And I thought a little frivolity,00:22:56
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,would be just what the doctor ordered.,00:22:59
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Helly, please approach the MDE cart. You may choose one genre and one accessory.",00:23:01
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,The maraca. Excellent choice.,00:23:15
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,Should’ve gone for the castanets.,00:23:18
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,I choose “Defiant Jazz.”,00:23:22
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Though this experience is in Helly’s honor, I urge all the refiners to take advantage of the opportunity presented.",00:23:26
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Wow.,00:23:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,Okay.,00:23:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Cheers.,00:23:56
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,I’m nervous!,00:23:57
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Come on, Mark.",00:24:20
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Irving, what you got? Let’s see it.",00:24:42
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan’s son,Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.,00:25:29
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,What is his name? Tell me his name!,00:25:38
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Dylan! Get him off me!,00:25:38
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Get him off me!,00:25:42
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,He’s biting me!,00:25:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Dylan, what the hell!",00:25:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Jesus Christ! Dylan! Come on, Dylan!",00:25:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,He’s biting me!,00:25:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,He broke the skin.,00:26:03
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,He needs a full tetanus toxoid panel.,00:26:05
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"You’ve done it now, Dylan. I’m reporting this to Ms. Cobel.",00:26:10
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,"Yeah, you wanna go see her together?",00:26:14
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,The Music Dance Experience is officially canceled.,00:26:30
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,What is wrong with you?,00:26:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,They can wake us up.,00:26:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,What?,00:26:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,On the outside. It’s called the overtime contingency.,00:26:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,What are you talking about?,00:26:56
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,"Last night, after I went up the elevator, I woke up outside, in my house, with Milchick.",00:26:58
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,What?,00:27:05
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,I saw my son.,00:27:09
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,"And then he hugged me. He was so happy to see me. Then Milchick pulled him off, and it was over.",00:27:16
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,"It happened so fast, I just keep trying to remember more.",00:27:28
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Jesus, Dylan. That’s crazy.",00:27:31
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,"Yeah, it’s not fair.",00:27:31
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,And now I’m just supposed to have that in my head every day here. And I never get to see him again.,00:27:35
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,"He’s not your son, Dylan. He’s your Outie’s son.",00:27:39
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,That’s bullshit. He’s my son too.,00:27:42
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,This is good. We could use this.,00:27:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,What?,00:27:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,"If they can wake us up on the outside, what’s to stop us from doing it to ourselves?",00:27:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,What’s to stop us?,00:27:54
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,"We can find whatever they use to control it and, you know, commandeer it. We can all see the outside, find out who we are.",00:27:56
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,"But, Helly, forgive me, but that’s perverse. We’re Innies. Plus, the controls are surely somewhere we can’t access.",00:28:04
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Like the Security Office?,00:28:13
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,Is that…,00:28:16
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,Graner’s key card?,00:28:18
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,Where did you find it?,00:28:20
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,In my pocket,00:28:20
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,during the Music Dance Experience. I think I must’ve had it with me when I came in today.,00:28:22
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,Why does your Outie have the key card of our head of security?,00:28:27
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,I don’t know.,00:28:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,I think it’s time for a field trip.,00:28:40
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,To the security office where all the security guards work? Amazing. Yeah.,00:28:42
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,Who’s to say there are security guards? I’ve only ever seen Graner.,00:28:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,What about Milchick?,00:28:49
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,He can’t be everywhere at once.,00:28:49
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,This whole line of con…,00:28:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,Do you know where the office is?,00:28:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Petey saw it during a fire alarm last year. He showed me.,00:28:55
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,We can do this.,00:29:02
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Look, if Milchick does show up, stall him.",00:29:15
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,I got it.,00:29:18
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:29:18
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Hopefully this works.,00:29:32
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,No cavalry yet.,00:29:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, it’s a ways past Perpetuity, so…",00:29:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Irving.,00:29:51
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,"I’m sorry, Mark.",00:29:52
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Where you going?,00:29:53
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,I have to make sure Burt’s okay.,00:29:53
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,What about the plan?,00:29:56
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,"I… I’m sorry, Mark. I can’t hear you! I’ll be back!",00:29:57
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,I mean…,00:30:01
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:30:01
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,Okay.,00:30:05
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,It’s this one.,00:30:33
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,This is fucking weird.,00:31:16
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,It’s over here.,00:31:27
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, my God.",00:31:38
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,"Look, that’s us.",00:31:45
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,What’s the name of that thing? The oversight something?,00:31:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,The overtime contingency.,00:31:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Shit.,00:31:58
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Shit.,00:32:08
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:32:08
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,It’s Cobel.,00:32:14
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,She won’t come here.,00:32:15
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Okay. It’s great you know that. Let’s get the fuck outta here.,00:32:18
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Natalie,"Harmony, I was looking for you.",00:32:35
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,Now isn’t a good…,00:32:36
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Natalie,I have the Board here.,00:32:36
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,Right now?,00:32:39
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Natalie,Doug Graner is dead.,00:32:41
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,What?,00:32:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Natalie,The Board finds this deeply troubling. The Board wants to know if you knew he was missing and if you’ve spoken to the police.,00:32:48
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,Whoever killed Mr. Graner is probably the same person who reintegrated Peter Kilmer.,00:32:58
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Natalie,The Board reminds you that reintegration is not…,00:33:07
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,Reintegration happened. And I have the data to prove it. And I would be happy to share my findings in person without intermediaries.,00:33:09
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Natalie,The Board agrees…,00:33:28
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Natalie,And will be available to meet with you at the Eagan Family Gala next week to discuss this further. Details to come.,00:33:33
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Cobel,I look forward to receiving them.,00:33:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,"So, no one is in there? That’s lax as fuck.",00:34:29
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"Well, maybe it’s enough that we think we’re constantly being watched.",00:34:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,It’s too bad nobody told you guys that everything here is bullshit.,00:34:37
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Is that making sense?,00:34:40
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,Yeah.,00:34:40
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,"There’s a bunch of steps, but it’s actually pretty straightforward. You just engage the trackball, type the code, then it’s switch, type, flip,",00:34:42
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,"type, hold.",00:34:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,What?,00:34:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,"Trackball, type, switch, type, flip, type, hold. Boom.",00:34:54
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,What? I’m smart. That’s why I have three times as many finger traps as you guys.,00:34:58
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,"But to do this, one of us has to stay behind, right?",00:35:04
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,"Yeah, after work. I can do it. I’ve already been out, so it’s only fair.",00:35:07
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,"Very noble of you, but I think it’s designed as a two-man operation.",00:35:10
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,Great. I have the strength of two men.,00:35:13
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,It’s not about strength.,00:35:16
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Helly,"Yeah, see. There are two lever switches that you have to hold open during the actual procedure. And they’re on either side of the door.",00:35:18
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Dylan,I can do it.,00:35:28
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Ladies and gentlemen, how about a round of applause for the man of the hour? Come and circle up! Gather round.",00:35:33
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),O&D designers (chanting),"Burt, Burt, Burt.",00:35:45
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Greetings, Designers…and one Refiner. We’ll have to get those doors looked at.",00:35:56
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,In the meantime…Burt G. This is for you.,00:36:06
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"Hello. This is kinda strange, but…a lot of things about this job are. You all know that better than me, I’m guessing. And, of course, I don’t really know any of you, but the man standing there with you now does. He’s worked with you for nearly seven years, and I hope they’ve been good years.",00:36:19
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"I… I don’t know what they’ve been like, or what exactly I, or he, has been doing with you, but I do know how I feel every day when I come from being with you. I come home feeling tired but fulfilled. I feel satisfied. I must like you very much. And though today is my last day with you, I’m certain you will remain with me in spirit in some deep, yet completely unaccessible, corner of my mind.",00:36:46
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"The impression you’ve left on me is indelible, though I’m unaware of it on a conscious level, and…I will never forget any of you, even though sitting here right now, I have no recollection of actually ever meeting you and no idea of your names or any of your physical characteristics or even how many of you there are.",00:37:18
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"Anyway, I just wanna say, thank you, all.",00:37:42
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"And Burt, I see you. Congratulations.",00:37:44
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"Good job, buddy.",00:37:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,Bon voyage.,00:37:53
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,You’re all just gonna stand here…and let him die?,00:38:10
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"Irving, what?",00:38:17
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,Are we being punished for defying the guidance of the founder?,00:38:19
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,Burt’s Outie is retiring. It’ll happen to you too someday.,00:38:25
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,You smug motherfucker.,00:38:30
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,"You’re not severed. You walk out of here with your memories. You carry them home with you every night. No one can rip them away from you, snuff them out. Like they never existed. Like you never existed!",00:38:34
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,That’s enough! You will go back to MDR.,00:38:50
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Burt,"Mr. Milchick, please. It’d be so wonderful to have him here. He won’t say anything more.",00:38:53
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"You can stay for Burt’s party and support his transition. But only if you behave in a manner that brings no shame upon yourself, the founder or his progeny.",00:39:12
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,I don’t know what’s gotten into you people today.,00:39:25
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Irving,"Yes, Mr. Milchick.",00:39:36
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,"Now, let’s all say goodbye to Burt.",00:39:41
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Milchick,I hope you all will enjoy Burt G.’s Innie retirement song selection.,00:39:54
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Music Cue,"Good morning, yesterday.",00:40:16
1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Mark,Irving?,00:42:15

1,7,Defiant Jazz (Transcript),Alexa,You know what? You can talk about her. You can not talk about her.,00:44:45

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Danise,"Well, that was awkward.",00:06:57
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, so my sister has the baby. And Cobel is here?",00:07:00
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Rebeck,I’ve been asked to share my book with you.,00:07:08
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,So I’ve heard. Rebecca?,00:07:11
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Rebeck,"Rebeck. I have small eyes, so I have to read pretty close.",00:07:13
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Okay. Well, I’m…I’m sure that’ll be fine. If you’ll excuse me?",00:07:16
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Rebeck,And I have some sores on the back of my head from my bird.,00:07:19
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Rebeck,You might see them.,00:07:22

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,What do you… What’s going on?,00:07:44
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Can we talk privately?,00:07:47
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,I just have to…,00:07:48
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,"Okay, my dearest ones,",00:07:48
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,"we are nearing that hour, so if you’d all peacefully waft in the living room…",00:07:51

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Gabby,Couldn’t have done it without a little help.,00:09:02
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Gabby,"I mean, the idea that people would want to outlaw severance.",00:09:05
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,I know.,00:09:11
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Angelo,"The photo display is very moving. I already knew how I’d be voting, but I think…",00:09:31
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Angelo,"Well, seeing that and seeing you and hearing what you have to say, all of this could really make a difference.",00:09:38
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,I hope so.,00:09:46
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Angelo,Let’s change some minds.,00:09:48
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,"Well, I’m certainly gonna try.",00:09:51
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Angelo,Thank you. And please thank your father if you see him.,00:09:53
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,I will.,00:10:02
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Rebeck,Mark. Come here. Saved us a seat.,00:10:15
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Rebeck,I just have to find my glasses.,00:10:24
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Rebeck,"Mark, can you just hold that for a second?",00:10:28
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:10:30
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, my God.",00:10:40
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,"Sorry, you can’t unring the bell-ringing app apparently.",00:10:43
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,Okay. Thank you all for being here.,00:10:52
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,"Before we start, there is one person that I would like to thank first and foremost. Family is both my bedrock and my inspiration. So I dedicate the reading to my firstborn daughter, who is here tonight. Eleanor, I love you.",00:10:56
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,My brother-in-law.,00:11:20
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,And with that… I begin.,00:11:22
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,"“It’s said that as a child, Wolfgang Mozart killed another boy by slamming his head in a piano. Don’t worry. My research for this book has proven the claim untrue. As your heart rate settles though,”",00:11:30

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,Mark.,00:11:45
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,Can I look at her book too?,00:11:48
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,I can crane.,00:11:50
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,“…can hold over a reader…”,00:11:52

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,Balf. Prepare the neti pot.,00:14:20
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Rebeck,It was transformative.,00:14:23
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Rebeck,I’m gonna have to change my name again.,00:14:25
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,What a wordsmith. He seemed to have a little something in his throat.,00:14:27
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, yeah.",00:14:31

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,Okay.,00:14:36
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Excuse me.,00:14:42
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Mr. Hale… Ricken?,00:14:54
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,I don’t know why my voice shakes like that. I sound like a sad old hamburger waiter prattling on about sauces.,00:14:57

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,"Mark, are you okay?",00:15:25
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Yes. This book changed my whole life.,00:15:26
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,You actually read it?,00:15:31

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Do you have that on you? The picture?,00:15:56
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,"Yeah, sure. I should.",00:16:00
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Balf,Ricken. The neti pot is warm.,00:16:04
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,"Thank you, Balf.",00:16:04
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Ricken,"Mark, I need to flush my sinuses. But thank you. You have no idea how much this has meant to me.",00:16:07
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,"Mark, I was worried about you.",00:16:24
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,I’m fine. Thanks. I’m just going to check on my sister.,00:16:26
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,"When you hugged me before, you suddenly became tense. What was that?",00:16:31
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,I didn’t know I did.,00:16:37
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,"Well, you did. You’re tense now.",00:16:38
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, sorry, it’s just parties.",00:16:41
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,Did you mean what you said before? About your plans.,00:16:44
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Of course.,00:16:51
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,Tell me more.,00:16:53
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"You know, I’m so sorry. I’m just…I’m on uncle duty for my sister. So I’ll be right back.",00:16:59
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Okay?,00:17:04
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,Okay.,00:17:04

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Hey, I really need to talk to you.",00:17:57
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,"No, I know. I just have to deal with her. She’s having a meltdown. But just meet me in there, okay?",00:18:00
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, I’ll just… Wait. Okay.",00:18:04
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,I promise I’ll be back.,00:18:04
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,"Thank God, Mrs. Selvig. Hi. Can you take her for a sec while I talk to Mark?",00:18:14

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,"My name is Helena, and I’m an Eagan.",00:18:50
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,"So, one of the things you learn growing up as an Eagan is that the workers are our family. And I remember being confused about that as a kid, because I thought that meant I had a few hundred thousand literal brothers and sisters scattered around the world. Oh, my God.",00:18:55
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,"But as I grew older, I learned that it’s about shared ideals. My dad used to make me recite the nine Core Principles before bed every night, which I can’t say I always did happily. Sorry, Dad.",00:19:09
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,"But those are now the values that I share with everyone who works at Lumon, and that’s what makes them my family. And I would never ever ask them to do anything that I’m not willing or excited to do myself.",00:19:20
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,"Look, my dad would love for me to sit here and say that I’m taking this job out of loyalty and that it was the spirit of Kier Eagan calling me to service.",00:19:33
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,But I took a severed job because it sounds freaking awesome.,00:19:44
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,"So, no, I don’t think severance divides us. I think it brings us together.",00:19:50
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Milchick (voicemail),Greetings. I’m not here right now…,00:20:14
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,"Goddamn it, Milchick!",00:20:15

1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Jame,You look so nice. Like a film.,00:22:28
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,Thank you.,00:22:36
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Jame,Are you…Are you still in pain?,00:22:41
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,I’m not. Not anymore.,00:22:48
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Jame,I cried in my bed when they told me what she tried to do to you. What that Innie tried to do. I…,00:22:58
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Jame,Thank you for going through with this. The Grandfather would cherish what you’ve done. And one day you will sit with me at my revolving.,00:23:09
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Jame,Are you feeling well?,00:23:25
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,"Yeah. I think, I think the drink just hit me a little bit.",00:23:27
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Jame,You’ll be all right for the speech?,00:23:35
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,For my speech. Yeah. Of course.,00:23:39
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Jame,Do you remember when I brought home the first chip to show you? The prototype. It had the blue and green lights back then.,00:23:44
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,Yeah.,00:23:58
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Jame,"I remember you said to me, “It’s so pretty, Daddy. Everybody in the whole world should get one.”",00:24:00
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Jame,They will. Because of you. They’ll all be Kier’s children.,00:24:11
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Natalie,Mr. Eagan. Helena. It’s time to head to stage.,00:24:25
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Helly,Forgive me for the harm I’ve caused this world. None may atone for my actions…but me. And only in me shall their stain live on. All I can be is sorry. And that is all I am.,00:24:54
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,You swear you’re not fucking with me?,00:27:06
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,I swear.,00:27:09
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,This is so insane.,00:27:11
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"They need to send people down to check every inch of that place. Like, inspectors or whatever. Is that a thing? Inspectors?",00:27:13
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,Yeah. There are inspectors.,00:27:19
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,"Mark has b… I mean, out here, you have been trying to figure out what Lumon does. What you do.",00:27:22
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Okay. I just…I just want to know why. Why he put me in there.,00:27:27
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,He lost his wife. You lost your wife. A little before you started at Lumon.,00:27:46
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Gemma.,00:27:52
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,"It was a car accident, and, at first, you tried to keep teaching.",00:27:55
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,I was a teacher?,00:28:01
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,"A professor. Of history. You tried to go back to teaching three weeks after she died, and it was a disaster. She was just still in your veins, you know? Making everything hurt.",00:28:03
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,Which is why I guess you thought the severed job would…,00:28:20
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,He hoped you’d be spared from the pain.,00:28:27
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,It’s a nice name. Gemma.,00:28:38
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,Yeah.,00:28:43
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,We were all really close. It was great.,00:28:46
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,She was wonderful. She made you wonderful.,00:28:50
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Milchick,They told me not to talk to you.,00:29:43
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,The goddamn OTC’s been triggered! Mark S. is his fucking Innie!,00:29:44
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Milchick,What? That’s not possible.,00:29:49
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,It’s Dylan. They’ve been plotting this all along.,00:29:52
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Milchick,Helly’s at the gala.,00:29:55
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Cobel,"I’ll take care of Helly. I’ll fix it like I fix everything. Get to the Security Office, and shut it off now!",00:29:56
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Milchick,Shit!,00:30:04
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Milchick,Goddamn it! Dylan! Dylan!,00:30:25
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Milchick,"I know you’re in there, Dylan. Open the door!",00:30:29
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Dylan,"Fuck you, Mr. Milchick!",00:30:31
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Milchick,Dylan! Dylan!,00:30:34
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,"I mean, Ricken knows a lot of high-end journalists in New York.",00:30:39
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,And you think that’s better than the police?,00:30:41
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,"Well, Lumon has their hands in so many pies. Sorry, do you understand metaphor?",00:30:43
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, hands in pies. I get it.",00:30:47
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,I think we have to be really careful about who we talk to.,00:30:49
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:30:51
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,How much time do you have?,00:30:51
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,I don’t know. Maybe an hour?,00:30:53
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,Right. Because once your bosses find out…,00:30:55
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Jesus, I totally forgot. Cobel! Why is Cobel here?",00:30:57
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,What?,00:31:01
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,My boss from Lumon. Ms. Cobel. She’s at this party.,00:31:02
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,What are you talking about?,00:31:05
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"I mean, she’s dressed different. Kind of a flowy, purple outfit, silver hair.",00:31:06
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,"Mark, are you talking about Mrs. Selvig?",00:31:13
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Maybe, but her name is Harmony Cobel.",00:31:15
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,And she works at Lumon?,00:31:18
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, she’s my boss.",00:31:20
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Devon,Jesus fucking Christ.,00:31:21
1,9,The We We Are (Transcript),Milchick,"Dylan. Why are you doing this, man?",00:31:50

2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,"I locked you in a room like an animal, Mark. As an unsevered man, I'll carry that knowledge the rest of my life.

2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,No.,00:13:31
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Gwendolyn Y,Probably because it's an older branch. Ours were animatronic. They even did this little choreographed dance.,00:13:36

2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,Wait. He tackled you?,00:21:07
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Yeah, bad. Which– I mean, fair, I tackled the man first, but I didn't fuck with his belt. “Kier pardons his betrayers”?",00:21:09
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,Burt!,00:21:16
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Dude, are you okay?",00:21:24
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Irving, what happened?",00:21:45
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"The fuck? Irv! Dude, what's wrong? You poor up there?",00:21:46
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Come on. Helly! Oh, my God. Are you okay?",00:21:54
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,I'm okay. Did you wake up?,00:22:07
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Yeah, it was crazy.",00:22:09
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,Same.,00:22:09
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Oh, my God. I was so worried about you.",00:22:11
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,How long has it been?,00:22:13
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Five months, maybe more.",00:22:13
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,Where's everybody else?,00:22:16
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,Come on. They're gone.,00:22:17
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,Irving?,00:22:26
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,He won't come out.,00:22:28
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Hey, Irv?",00:22:32
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,"I'm sorry, Mark. I just need a moment, please.",00:22:34
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,Okay. Take your time.,00:22:37
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Okay, so what is going on? We're not in trouble?",00:22:39
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"I don't think so. I mean, Milchick said our message got out. He said we're famous.",00:22:41
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"All of us equally or one of us is, like, the star?",00:22:45
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"I don't know. But then he tried to fire me, I think.",00:22:47
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Why?,00:22:50
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Well, because I sort of sabotaged the new people.",00:22:52
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,New people?,00:22:55
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"So, what the fuck happened up there?",00:22:55
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Well, look, Milchick is probably coming.",00:22:58
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Good. I owe him a fucking belt cut. Now tell me.,00:23:00
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"What if they're waiting for us to tell each other what happened because they don't know what happened? I mean, what if they're listening, Dylan?",00:23:03
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"Wait, what happened to the security camera?",00:23:09
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,"I– I'm sorry, I was… just–",00:23:13
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Are you okay?,00:23:23
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Miss Huang,"Hi, everyone. I'm Miss Huang. Mr. Milchick's waiting for you in the break room.",00:23:25
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"What the fuck is going on? Why is she, like, eight?",00:23:41
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,I don't know.,00:23:43
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"Wait, so they replaced us?",00:23:45
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,For a couple days.,00:23:46
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Who was me?,00:23:48
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"They weren't, like, specific counterparts. They were, I don't know, weird.",00:23:49
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Okay. Well, I don't think you should feel bad at all.",00:23:53
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,Feel bad?,00:23:55
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Yeah, for ending their lives. Fuck 'em.",00:23:55
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Well, I wasn't trying to–",00:23:58
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"No, dude, I'm saying don't feel bad. Like, I'm sure they deserved it.",00:24:00
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,"Macrodata Refinement. Welcome back. Please, take a seat. Irving, if you wouldn't mind being in back. Tall glass of water.",00:25:28
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,I guess the Board reconsidered my terms.,00:25:45
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,Guess so. What you're about to see will be shown to every innie who sets foot in this building after today. I hope it will give you a sense of Lumon's feelings.,00:25:49
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Lumon Building,"Hi. You probably don't recognize me from this angle. I'm the Lumon Administrative Building, branch 501. And you're sitting in me right now. The name's a mouthful, or as I say, a “doorful.” So you can just call me Lumon. I've gone through a lot of changes since my siring here in 1870. But one thing I've always had is a love for my workers, both unsevered and severed. Not to brag, but my basement floor is one of the premier severed workspaces in the 206 countries from which Lumon operates. Hey, no running in my halls! That tickles. But what makes a building truly happy? This question came to light when four MDR workers, dissatisfied with their severed lives, conspired to mount what Lumon historians will forever call the Macrodat Uprising. Under my literal nose unfolded a human drama of danger and intrigue. Righteous anger.",00:26:22
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B (voice),Let's burn this place to the ground.,00:27:38
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Lumon Building,Inspiration.,00:27:46
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S (voice),Why are we down here still working in the dark?,00:27:48
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Lumon Building,And love.,00:27:56
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,What the shit?,00:28:01
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Lumon Building,"The Macrodat Uprising yielded bounteous reforms. These include tasty new snacks, like fruit leather, cut beans, Christmas mints, and salsa. Not sold yet? The incentives were also reformed and now range from hall passes to pineapple bobbing… to our brand-new playful mirror room. You know, it's funny. I've sat by this reflective pool my whole life, yet it took the quiet courage of four MDR heroes to show me who I really am.",00:28:05
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Water Tower,They made quite a splash.,00:28:59
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Lumon Building,"They sure did, Water Tower. And I thank Kier for them. I thank Kier for the Macrodat Uprising.",00:29:02
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,"I know we have our differences… but I want you to know that I truly respect each and every one of you. And I don't wanna be your jailer. By end of day, each of you will choose whether you want to remain here. Not your outies, but you. If you start work on your file, I'll assume you want to stay. If not, I'll send you to the surface. No ill will. Maybe I'll even buy you a drink at a bistro one day. Like the rest of the severed floor, the break room has no cameras or microphones. Privacy shouldn't mean packing into a supply closet like so many sardines. I truly hope you all will choose to stay and enjoy what you've helped build. A new quarter. A fresh start. For all of us.",00:29:31
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,What the hell was that?,00:30:52
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Massive-ass head game is what that was. So what the hell did you guys see up there?,00:30:53
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,Well…,00:31:00
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,He said there were no microphones in here.,00:31:01
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Yeah, he says a lot of shit, so just fucking whisper it.",00:31:03
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Okay. So, I was at a party at my sister's house for Ricken Hale.",00:31:05
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"Wait, what?",00:31:12
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,You know Ricken Hale?,00:31:13
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,He's my outie's brother-in-law.,00:31:15
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,What?,00:31:17
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"And for some reason, we both know Cobel.",00:31:18
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,That's insane.,00:31:23
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Yeah. Well, there's something else. Just before I switched back, I found a wedding photo. Now, I guess my outie's wife died a few years ago.",00:31:25
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Oh, shit.",00:31:36
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Which, apparently, is part of why I decided to get severed. Except… the woman in the photo was Ms. Casey.",00:31:38
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,Ms. Casey is your wife?,00:31:55
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,Is my outie's wife.,00:31:57
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,But she's dead.,00:31:58
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"No, I know, but it was her.",00:32:00
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,Then she's down here.,00:32:07
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,No. I went to Wellness. It's gone.,00:32:09
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"What do you mean, gone?",00:32:13
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"I mean, it's gone.",00:32:14
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"Oh, my God. Mark, are you okay?",00:32:18
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Yeah. Well, I don't know. What about you? What did you see?",00:32:23
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,I saw the inside of a really fucking boring apartment.,00:32:33
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"So, you live by yourself?",00:32:41
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"Yeah. I was watching some nature show on TV, wearing sweatpants and a T-shirt.",00:32:44
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"What kind of T-shirt? Did it feature, like, a band or pocket?",00:32:52
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,It was like a “save the gorillas” shirt.,00:32:56
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Cool.,00:32:59
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,I guess.,00:33:00
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,And then what?,00:33:04
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"Then I went outside and found a guy. He looked like a gardener. Told him everything. I think he kind of thought it was bullshit. But he said that his brother was a cop and that he would tell him everything. I don't know. Sorry, guys. I really tried.",00:33:06
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,A gardener?,00:33:28
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,Yeah.,00:33:32
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,A night gardener?,00:33:34
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"I think so. I mean, maybe he has a different job during the day.",00:33:37
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"What about you, Irv?",00:33:43
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,Do you suppose he's serious? About letting us leave?,00:33:49
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Irv, what did you see?",00:34:02
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,It's not our world up there. That's what I saw.,00:34:07
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Come on, man. You can tell us.",00:34:15
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"Yeah, it's okay. Even if it's bad.",00:34:23
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Irv.,00:35:03
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,I just wanna walk for a bit.,00:35:04
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,I'll talk to him.,00:35:09
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"No, no. We should all go.",00:35:09
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"No. He's fine, okay? Let me talk him down. You go back to camp. I'll get you if I need you.",00:35:11
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,Are you sure? You–,00:35:15
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,But–,00:35:15
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Hey, Irv's gonna be okay, right?",00:35:30
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,Yeah. Dylan's on it. And we have till the end of the day.,00:35:33
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,Yeah.,00:35:39
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,Did you guys look happy in the wedding photo?,00:35:48
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Yeah, we did. You know, I never, like– Ms. Casey and I never felt that way.",00:35:54
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"Okay. So, what are you gonna do?",00:36:06
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Well… I gotta get her out of here. Right? I mean, if she's my wife…",00:36:13
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"Right. Of course. I mean, assuming she's still here. Though technically, strictly speaking, she's not your wife. I'm pretty sure your outie bought the ring.",00:36:25
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"Sure. Except, you know, we're the same-ish person. So, it's mushy.",00:36:38
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,It's mushy? Is that what it is? Mushy? Okay.,00:36:49
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,"It's… yeah. Listen, Helly—",00:36:49
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,"We're not the same, actually. Us and the outies, we're not. And speaking for myself, I don't think we owe them shit. But Ms. Casey is– Well, she's one of us. So, if you wanna help your outie and find out what happened to her… I'll help.",00:36:54
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,So you're staying?,00:37:26
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Helly R,I think I'm staying.,00:37:32
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Irv. Hold up.,00:37:47
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,"Leave me alone, Dylan.",00:37:47
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Oka– Dude. Is it– You can't leave until the end of the day.,00:37:49
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,Are you sure?,00:37:56
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Irv.,00:37:58
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,I failed at the objective.,00:37:59
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,What?,00:38:03
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,I went to go find Burt.,00:38:04
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Okay. Did you see him?,00:38:08
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,"He's married, or, at least, he's with someone. I saw them through the window.",00:38:11
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Shit.,00:38:21
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,I should be happy he's happy.,00:38:23
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Yeah. But seems like you're probably not, right?",00:38:26
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,"The last time I was happy was when all I knew was MDR. When I was good at my job and not trying to be happy. I'm going to leave, Dylan.",00:38:33
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,It is not leaving. So stop fucking calling it that.,00:38:46
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,"I know, you want– I know–",00:38:48
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Just fucking try.,00:38:48
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,"You're a good friend, Dylan. Before I went to Burt's, I woke up in my apartment.",00:39:01
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,What?,00:39:13
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,I was standing in front of some kind of easel.,00:39:16
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Fuck. There's easels up there?,00:39:19
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,Yeah. My outie was working on a painting of a hallway. A black hallway.,00:39:21
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Like the break room one?,00:39:26
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,"No, it was different. Darker. There was an elevator at the end with a downward arrow. He painted dozens of them.",00:39:28
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Fuck. Why?,00:39:36
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,I don't know. And I wanted you to know before I left.,00:39:37
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Okay. Well, you're not. You– No.",00:39:42
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,Stop it. Listen to me.,00:39:44
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Look, I'm sorry that outie Burt has a hot husband or whatever. But he is not the point. Innie Burt is the guy you fell for, and I know because I encouraged the courtship.",00:39:46
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,I– I want it to be over.,00:39:58
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Okay. So then after you find the black hallway or–,00:40:02
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,I want the pain to be over. If he's gone and I'm gone…,00:40:06
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Stop saying that.,00:40:14
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,"…then somehow, we'll be together.",00:40:15
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,He wouldn't want that.,00:40:17
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,How do you know?,00:40:18
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Because I don't want that. Because I would be sad, and I would be less productive, and I'm really good at what I do here, whatever it is. And you're part of what makes me good at it. So please, do not go.",00:40:22
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,Dylan. I'm your favorite perk.,00:40:44
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,"Don't bring them into this. All I'm saying is, if Burt was still here, he would be telling you to stick around and figure out what the fuck this is.",00:40:57
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Miss Huang,Dylan G.? Mr. Milchick would like to see you.,00:41:07
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,Right.,00:41:26
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,"I know, but they said it would be corrected by now. It should be Mr. Milchick. M-R-period-space-M-I-L-C-H-I-C-K. Well, I sympathize…",00:41:54
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Miss Huang,Mr. Milchick–,00:41:54
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,"…but could you please see that it's taken care of? Yes. Thank you. If someone calls about my welcome screen, I need you to put that call through immediately.",00:42:09
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Miss Huang,"Yes, sir.",00:42:19
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,You wanted to see me?,00:42:22
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,"I did. Thank you, Miss Huang.",00:42:25
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,You gonna apologize about the belt?,00:42:38
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,Your wife's name is Gretchen.,00:42:49
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,What?,00:42:55
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,"She wanted you to know. Come with me. And I do apologize, Dylan, for not being a better listener. For not hearing your needs. Take a look. These are blueprints for a new renovation, of which I chose not to inform your colleagues. It's called the Outie Family Visitation Suite.",00:42:57
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Are you saying I could see my family here?,00:43:44
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,"If you take the name of the room at face value, I'd say yes.",00:43:48
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Holy fuck.,00:43:56
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,"The holiest. Sadly, everyone else in your department is single. As such, I'm asking that you keep this between us…",00:43:58
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Are you–,00:44:07
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Milchick,…only to avoid resentment. I'd hate for your friends to turn against you after all you've done for them.,00:44:07
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,You okay?,00:45:46
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,I'm okay.,00:45:48
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Mark S,Where's Irv?,00:45:49
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,Right here.,00:45:54
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Dylan G,Irv. You okay?,00:46:04
2,9,"Hello, Ms. Cobel (Transcript)",Irving B,I'm okay.,00:46:08
2,9,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig (Transcript)",Mark,Devon!,00:00:13
2,9,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig (Transcript)",Helly,"No. Listen, we're not happy, we're miserable.",00:00:16
2,9,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig (Transcript)",Irving,Burt!,00:00:19

2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Where did you come from?,00:02:30
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,I don't know.,00:02:32
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,What are we doing out here?,00:02:33

2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Did you wake up on the ice too?,00:03:00
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. What about you?,00:03:00
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,On the cliff.,00:03:01
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,"Oh, my God.",00:03:05
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,Is it you?,00:03:09
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Of course it's us.,00:03:09
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,"Holy shit! Out-fucking-side. Oh, my God. I mean, I knew there was no actual ceiling, but this is fucking insane.",00:03:11
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Hello? Hello?,00:03:22
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,What is that?,00:03:35
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"Good morning, Refiners.",00:04:30
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"This is Mr. Milchick from work, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to your first ever outdoor retreat and team-building occurrence.",00:04:33
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"This ORTBO is in response to your desire to see the outside world. With your outies' blessings, you will spend the next two calendar days walking the meadows, thickets, brambles and brooks that make up the Dieter Eagan National Forest.",00:04:44
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,Who the fuck is Dieter Eagan?,00:05:03
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"Dieter Eagan? Some of you may be quietly yearning to learn more. The truth you seek lies within the fourth appendix. Kier dictated a fourth appendix in his final hours of life, a text of such sanctity that it is forbidden upon the severed floor. It's waiting for you in Scissor Cave, the very same grotto where Kier Eagan tamed the four tempers for the very first time.",00:05:07
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"And do remember, “Stray not from Kier's path, lest you roil nature's wrath.” There will be help along the way. Happy fortunes, MDR.",00:05:39
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Scissor Cave.,00:06:04
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,What the fuck is that?,00:06:17
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,He looks like Mark.,00:06:28
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Milchick said there'd be help along the way.,00:06:42
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,I wouldn't trust a word out of that mountebank's mouth. Not even televisually.,00:06:46
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,"Not like we have a lot of other options right now, Irv.",00:07:05
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Wait.,00:09:48
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,“Chapter one.”,00:10:33
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,"“I was not born into this world alone. The lodgings of my mother's womb I shared with another, a twin brother who was called Dieter.”",00:10:36
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Kier had a twin?,00:10:47
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,That's what those things are.,00:10:50
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:10:53
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,"“In infancy, he was my bosom friend. But as we blossomed into boyhood, he beseeched me to take to the wood with him to live as paupers. My love for my twin unbalancing my judgment, I acceded, and we ventured into the wood towards…”",00:10:55
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly and Dylan,“Woe's Hollow.”,00:11:14
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,"So, we're to walk in the brothers' footsteps.",00:11:23
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,“He always crept like this at this hour.”,00:11:33
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,"“Once concealed by flora, my brother…”",00:11:37
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Kier,“…unfastened himself.”,00:11:41
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Kier,“The din of his fervor fell strangely into concert with the music of the wood.”,00:11:43
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Kier,“His every thrust found rhythm with the trill of the crickets…”,00:11:51
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Kier and Irving,“…and the moaning of the wind…”,00:11:57
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Kier and Irving,“…and the snowfall's yearly thaw.”,00:12:00
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Kier,"“Dieter became, on that night an instrument of nature…”",00:12:04
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Kier and Irving,“and nature played Dieter with elegance.”,00:12:09
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,“I had no choice but to listen as he spilt his lineage upon the soil.”,00:12:12
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,Now there's a me one.,00:12:43
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,You okay?,00:13:28
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Yeah. I just wish I knew where we were going.,00:13:31
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,Fuck.,00:13:59
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,What were you and Helly talking about back there?,00:14:24
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,When?,00:14:37
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,I don't trust her. I think she might be lying about what her outie saw.,00:14:39
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Why would you think that?,00:14:46
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Night gardeners.,00:14:48
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,It's clear you do not have an objective perspective due to your feelings for her.,00:14:52
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,"My feelings for her have nothing to do with anything, okay–",00:14:56
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,What the fuck?,00:15:20
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,What is it?,00:15:25
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,I don't know. Looks like a seal?,00:15:27
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Why does it look so messed up?,00:15:37
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,I don't know. Maybe this is what dead things look like.,00:15:40
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,We should eat it.,00:15:46
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,Pardon me?,00:15:48
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,We don't know if there's food waiting at the hollow. We don't even know where we are.,00:15:49
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,"They can't let anything happen to us. It's an ORTBO. Outdoor retreat team-building occurrence. Right, Mark?",00:15:54
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,We don't know what this is. We don't know anything!,00:16:01
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,"Irving, calm down.",00:16:04
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,We all know you had a bad experience the last time you were outside–,00:16:09
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Who said I had a bad experience?,00:16:12
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, my God.",00:16:14
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,"What did you tell him, dumbass?",00:16:17
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,Nothing! What the fuck?,00:16:19
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Let's just get to the hollow.,00:16:23
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,Kier's twin was always with him. That's why we provided the very same for each of you.,00:17:19
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,Fuck you all. I was right.,00:17:28
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Mr. Milchick.,00:17:30
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"This is the tallest waterfall on the planet. You have followed the path of Kier and Dieter, and reached Woe's Hollow. You stand upon sacred earth.",00:17:32
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,"We're starving, Mr. Milchick.",00:17:47
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"Are you? I thought the waterfall's grandeur would satiate you. I'm teasing, of course. Lumon will always protect and provide. Right this way.",00:17:50
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"Miss Huang has been readying the grill for which we brought in copious luxury meats. The fire will be used for marshmallows and a recital later. The tents, as you can see, are MDR blue and the outhouse is stocked with four-ply washroom tissue.",00:19:06
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Wow.,00:19:28
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"Wow, indeed, Helly R.",00:19:30
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"Also, for your comfort and safety, torches, which can provide both a heat and a light source. Double duty.",00:19:33
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,It's beautiful.,00:19:46
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Ms. Huang,"Pretty cool, right?",00:19:49
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,"Yes, lovely.",00:19:54
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Irving?,00:20:02
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Enter.,00:20:03
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Made you a snow seal. In case you were hungry.,00:20:18
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Yeah. I feel silly for suggesting we eat that animal. I suppose it sounded alarmist and paranoid. Irrational.,00:20:31
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,No. It was fine. We were all a little… Yeah.,00:20:44
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,What did you really see during the overtime contingency?,00:21:03
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,I told you.,00:21:14
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,It's okay. It won't change anything.,00:21:17
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Irving.,00:21:31
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Okay.,00:21:43
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"“Dieter lay unwashed in his bedroll, though the hollow's pool was primed for bathing. We ate of the hare we'd caught and told each other rhyming jokes till our gullets ached. But at last, the thought tickling my mouth emerged. 'We must return to Father,' I said. 'But I promise to look after you in the ether mill.' When at last a sound came from him, it was a bewailing whimper. He believed, I suppose, that we'd be woodland paupers forever.”",00:22:06
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"“I was looking at him when his eye came out. It popped from the socket, driven by a sudden torrent of pus from his skull. And he reached up to grasp at his hair, which was suddenly moss that tore easily from his bleeding scalp.”",00:22:48
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Good heavens.,00:23:10
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"“And as the pus from his eye thickened into sap, I turned from my gargling brother and walked to the pool of the hollow, where I knew the waterfall would drown out my brother's cries.”",00:23:11
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,That's actually really smart.,00:23:28
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"“And it was here that I first encountered the temper Woe, a gaunt bride, half the height of a natural woman. She spoke to me directly from her eyes and said, 'This is your doing. You suffered his wantonness. Now he's no one's brother. Only chaos's whore.'”",00:23:30
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,The end.,00:24:27
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"Perhaps in the morning, we'll have time for the next chapter… “Kier and the Thieving Nanny.”",00:24:35
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Creepy.,00:24:44
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,"Did his brother really die that way, Mr. Milchick?",00:24:47
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,The handbook enriches our work with tales of the founder's life. Every word is truth.,00:24:54
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,I'm sorry. Sorry.,00:25:06
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,Helly.,00:25:09
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:25:12
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,Helly R.?,00:25:17
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,"You guys… He melted, right? He turned into the forest because he masturbated. I mean, seriously, that's actually the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Right? He jerked off in front of his brother… and he got punished for it.",00:25:21
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Wha… You can't say that.,00:25:41
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,He just said it.,00:25:43
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Wha… He did. I… It's…,00:25:43
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"You know, we often laugh at what we don't understand. The team I thought I knew would have processed more thoughtfully.",00:25:51
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"Miss Huang. The marshmallows, please. Throw them in the fire.",00:26:06
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,"Mr. Milchick, come on.",00:26:25
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"Now, Miss Huang.",00:26:28
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,"Oh, my…",00:26:35
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,Why?,00:26:35
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,"Marshmallows are for team players, Dylan. They don't just hand them out.",00:26:38
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:26:50
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Milchick,Good night.,00:26:54
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Wow.,00:27:04
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, my God.",00:27:06
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,"Hey, what do you think his dick turned into?",00:27:09
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,It isn't funny.,00:27:19
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,I don't know. It's pretty funny.,00:27:22
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,"Well, it's not.",00:27:23
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:27:23
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,And stop making goo-goo eyes at her.,00:27:26
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,I'm not.,00:27:31
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Stop.,00:27:31
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,“Goo-goo eyes”?,00:27:34
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,"Just tell us, Helly.",00:27:38
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:27:41
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Come on. Tell us.,00:27:42
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Tell us what?,00:27:44
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Just tell us about him.,00:27:47
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Who?,00:27:49
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,The night gardener.,00:27:54
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, Irv, come on.",00:27:58
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Did he have a flashlight? What was he wearing?,00:28:00
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,"What is your deal right now, dude?",00:28:06
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,What color was his shirt? Did he have on a vest? A luminescent vest? Tell us…,00:28:08
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Okay.,00:28:08
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,…exactly what he was wear–,00:28:17
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Irving. That's enough.,00:28:17
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Enough?,00:28:19
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:28:19
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Using your pupils to make love to her while your outie's wife rots away somewhere.,00:28:21

2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Dylan,"Yeah. Fuck you, Irv.",00:28:29
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,"So it's three against one now, huh?",00:28:33
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,It's okay. We all know Irving's upset because he can't ever see Burt again. And he's really lonely.,00:28:40
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,"Hey, Irv.",00:29:19
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Irving,Fuck you all.,00:29:21

2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Dieter's penis.,00:30:19
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,"Yeah, or some other root vegetable.",00:30:27
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,That was mean of me… to say that to Irving.,00:30:46
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,"I mean, he kind of deserved it. And I can make goo-goo eyes at anyone I want. Are you okay?",00:30:59
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Sorry if I'm distracting you from…,00:31:29
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,From what?,00:31:34
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,From looking for your wife.,00:31:38

2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,I didn't like who I was on the outside. I was ashamed.,00:36:23
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,Who were you?,00:36:43
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Mark,I don't care who you are out there. I care who you are with me. That's all. Okay?,00:37:00
2,9,Woe's Hollow (Transcript),Helly,Are you okay? What happened? Are you okay?,00:37:26

2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Good, I guess. Although my innie fell off a rope, apparently.",00:04:01
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,A rope? Are you hurt?,00:04:05
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"No, I just got a little wet, that's all.",00:04:09
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,"Jesus, it's like it never ends with these guys. Do you know what the fuck actually happened?",00:04:11

2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,I can't keep coming in and out.,00:04:52
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,You think they're watching us?,00:04:56
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,Depends on how dumb you've played it.,00:04:58
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Hey, when do we keep going?",00:05:02
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,Maybe tonight. I'll decide later.,00:05:04

2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,You took the rest of the weekend to recover?,00:05:48
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helena,I'm fine. Will I be updating Father later? He should hear it from me.,00:05:51
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,We have decided to spare him knowledge of this contretemps.,00:06:06

2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,The medical team says your tempers will rebalance quickly.,00:06:20
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helena,Good to hear.,00:06:25
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,Some residual trauma is to be expected after such an ordeal. Perhaps we could arrange another obligement session this evening.,00:06:26
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helena,I said I'm fine.,00:06:36
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Natalie,"We're close, Helena. What's he at, 78%?",00:06:38

2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Natalie,It won't be you. It will be your innie.,00:06:56
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helena,My innie who tried to kill me? And then the other one tried to kill me. They're fucking animals. I'll just fake it again.,00:07:00
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Natalie,We can't take that chance.,00:07:19
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,We need to clean this up. Milchick's many errors this weekend have forced our hand.,00:07:21
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helena,And Father approves?,00:07:28
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,Father encouraged it.,00:07:32
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Natalie,It's a risk. We know this. But there is no other solution. Mark S. won't work without her.,00:07:38
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,And the work is mysterious and important. So we must give him her.,00:07:49

2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,"I need to know what's going on. Like, right now.",00:09:37
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,Where's Irving?,00:09:40
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,And why was he trying to drown me?,00:09:42
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,'Cause you're a fucking Eagan.,00:09:43
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Was she spying on us?,00:09:45
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,"Wait, what?",00:09:45
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,The whole time.,00:09:48
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,It's called a Glasgow block. It allows one's outie to–,00:09:49
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Wait. Are you saying that she was down here? As me?,00:09:55
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Maybe she still is.,00:09:59
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,"Hey, I repeat myself. Where is Irving?",00:10:00
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, where is he?",00:10:03
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,I'm so confused.,00:10:03

2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Excuse me. Helena Eagan, in her executive capacity, was conducting valuable research.",00:10:07
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,By stealing my fucking body?,00:10:22
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Irving had no knowledge of what management's intention was in this action, and in so doing, he nearly drowned you. Our only option was permanent dismissal.",00:10:25
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,So he is dead?,00:10:44
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,No. Irving B's outie has departed on an elongated cruise voyage.,00:10:47
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,I don't give three dry fucks about his outie.,00:10:54
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,She doesn't have the right to take my identity.,00:10:57
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,Have you ever heard the story of the Gråkappan?[1][2],00:11:10
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Let's assume we haven't.,00:11:22
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"In ancient times, the king of Sweden himself was known to go incognito amongst his people in the hopes of learning their true grievances. He would don an old, gray robe, a Gråkappan, the name for which he was remembered, to disguise his royal vestments. Kier Eagan himself was known to do so in his ether factories, and Ms. Eagan was carrying on this noble tradition.",00:11:32
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,This smells like horseshit.,00:12:10
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,"Yeah. Swedish horseshit, and Irving is still dead.",00:12:13
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"As I said, Irving B's outie has departed on an elonga–",00:12:19
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,"On an elongated cruise voyage. Yeah, I know. Is he gonna come back or not?",00:12:23
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,He is not.,00:12:41
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Wow. Some actual honesty.,00:12:46
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,You fucking murderers.,00:12:50
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,You can't do this to people.,00:12:52
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,It will take time to absorb all that has occurred. This went well. Allow me to escort you to MDR and help reacclimate you to your work environment.,00:12:55
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,What in the abominable fuck?,00:13:31
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,This is you.,00:13:47
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,Hell no. I'm not going near that thing.,00:13:48
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Dylan, please.",00:13:51
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,"If you're taking feedback, I hate it.",00:13:58
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Same.,00:14:00
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Well, the ORTBO was a challenge for us all in ways expected and non.",00:14:06
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,You mean like Jame Eagan's daughter Gråkappanning us?,00:14:19
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Careful, Dylan. Words have consequences. I'd hate to rescind certain privileges. As you can see, all of your items have been moved to your new work tri-stations. Hall passes will still be available.",00:14:24
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,Let us have a funeral.,00:14:40
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,I'm sorry?,00:14:43
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),138,"Irving is a person, and he's gone. So, we'd like to have a funeral. Not a retirement party, a funeral. Right?",00:14:45
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Yeah.,00:15:01
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,A funeral. Is this MDR's position?,00:15:05
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,Dude? Little help?,00:15:10
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Sure. As long as it's quick.,00:15:16
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,Quick?,00:15:19
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Quick. Yes. So it doesn't take up the whole day.,00:15:21
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Well said, Mark. I'll see if we can pull something together. In the meantime, let's make some forward progress on the files at hand. Shall we?",00:15:23
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,Thank you. Not you.,00:15:34

2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Hey.,00:16:32
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Are you okay?,00:16:36
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Uh-huh. No, not really.",00:16:37
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Yeah. This is seriously fucked up.,00:16:41
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:16:44
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,You couldn't tell? That she wasn't me?,00:16:51
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Obviously not.,00:16:56
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,What was she like?,00:16:59
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Like you. Or you're like her? I don't know. I don't know who you are, I guess.",00:17:06
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,"Yes, you do.",00:17:17
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:17:20
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,It's not my fault that my outie hijacked me.,00:17:24
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah. No, totally. I get it. It sucks.",00:17:27
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Mark…,00:17:34
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:17:34
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,What happened to you up there?,00:17:35
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Doesn't matter.,00:17:40
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,It doesn't matter?,00:17:41
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,No.,00:17:41
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Don't you want to hear what happened to me?,00:17:42
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"No, I don't. And let's just try to forget it. Okay?",00:17:44
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Huang,I thought bereavement events were for innies who die on the floor.,00:18:13
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Yes. Well, the Affections Index for Irving B. was in the high 60s. It will help the others to grieve.",00:18:19
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Huang,May I say a question?,00:18:33
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,You may.,00:18:35
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Huang,You shouldn't let them have a funeral. It makes them feel like people.,00:18:39
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,That wasn't a question. That was an opinion. Unsolicited.,00:18:48
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Huang,"Your first performance review is today, right? That was a question.",00:19:06
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,I'll ready the refreshments. You focus on the mournful signage.,00:19:25
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Today we honor Irving B. Normally, when an innie goes to be with Kier, we hold a retirement party, which they attend. But given the sudden and frigid events which brought us here, that's not feasible. As such, let us each take nine seconds to silently remember Irving and thank Kier for our time with him. There. You may now lift your heads and open your eyes. We will now have a eulogy from Dylan G.",00:19:41
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,"It's hard to pinpoint a favorite Irving story. For the least fun guy in the world, he was really fun. He put the “dick” in contradiction. One time, he was pissed at me for watering down the toner, so he put toner in my water cup. He stopped me before I drank it, though. He just wanted to make a point, not harm me physically. But I did accidentally take a sip of it later 'cause I forgot he said that. He asked me for help with something near the end, and I didn't listen. And in his final moments, he would have been totally justified in telling me to suck my own fuck. But he didn't. Yeah. He was awesome, and I miss him.",00:20:36
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Thank you, Dylan G. A little sugar with your usual salt. Thank you for your attendance and your participation. You may now briefly partake in Irving's fruit head, whose dark hair is courtesy of the Black Beauty Watermelon. From the country of Malaysia.",00:21:42
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,Miss Huang.,00:22:12
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Huang,I thought I was going to perform.,00:22:28
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Yes, well, I feel the theremin works best in moderation.",00:22:29
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Huang,But I practiced–,00:22:33
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,You can play your piece for me later. Yes?,00:22:33
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,You okay?,00:23:02
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,How about you?,00:23:06
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Okay. You're not staying?,00:23:08
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"I gotta get to work, but great ceremony, guys.",00:23:15

2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Mark…,00:23:25
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,Just let him go.,00:23:26
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,What?,00:23:29
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,"Irving was your friend, and he's dead. Why don't you give a shit?",00:23:32
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Because he's not dead. He's just not here.,00:23:35
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,You two catch up?,00:23:39
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,What's that?,00:23:41
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,You tell her Ms. Casey's your wife yet?,00:23:45
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,"Wait, what?",00:23:50
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, I mean, it's my outie's wife, but sure… No, it's pretty crazy.",00:23:53
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Mark.,00:24:00
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,"Mark, what the hell? Why won't you talk to me?",00:24:05
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"What do you want to talk about, Helly?",00:24:09
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,I don't know. Maybe the fact that Ms. Casey's your outie's wife? What are we gonna do?,00:24:11
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Well, we're not gonna do anything.",00:24:17
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Not gonna do anything?,00:24:19
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Seriously?,00:24:20
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Yes. Seriously.,00:24:20
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Come on. We'll work as a team. We'll figure this out.,00:24:23
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"“We'll”? There's no “we,” Helly.",00:24:26
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,What?,00:24:26
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,It doesn't matter.,00:24:29
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Why?,00:24:29
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Why?,00:24:31
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,Yeah. Why?,00:24:31
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Because they are smarter than us, okay? They know everything. Me looking for Ms. Casey, us wandering around, meeting other departments, mapping the floor, all of it. They know everything we're doing because Helena told them everything we're doing.",00:24:32
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,"That wasn't me. Mark, lo… I'm not her. I'm not. I'm me. Helly.",00:24:50
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,And how do I know that?,00:25:03
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Helly,You don't. You just have to trust me. This is real. Not everything here is a lie. And stop being a fucking asshole.,00:25:10
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Natalie,Your first performance review as Department Chief. Excited?,00:25:46
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,Very much so.,00:25:53
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Natalie,Shall we?,00:25:56
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Natalie, just before we begin, I was wondering if I could have a word with you. The paintings. I want you to understand I am grateful for them. Truly. If they're a measure of appreciation, then I accept that appreciation. I was just wondering if you could share with me a little how you felt when you received the paintings. Because I'm thinking our experiences here have been similar in some ways, we face similar challenges, and perhaps the paintings and the somewhat complicated feelings they evoke.",00:25:57
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Natalie,Mr. Drummond's waiting.,00:26:57
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Yes, of course. Let us go.",00:27:00
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Dylan,"Okay, asshole. Guess this is it. Sorry I let you down.",00:27:21
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,"Welcome, Mr. Milchick. Today, I will be conducting your monthly performance review. This review can take anywhere from two to six hours, depending on the number of atonements and approbations required. If the review is to take longer than four hours, there will be a break for lunch, with the order taken in advance.",00:28:34
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Well, I hope that won't be necessary.",00:28:54
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,Here is the lunch menu. Let's start with the positives. You received the gift of Kier paintings with grace. Your attendance and urinalysis are both in the excellent range.,00:28:59
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,Wonderful.,00:29:19
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,"Alternatively and sadly, there have been three contentions reported anonymously which have been investigated and confirmed. “One: uses too many big words.”",00:29:21
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Well, perchance I may colloquially employ a–",00:29:38
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,Anti-deflections will be heard after the lunch break.,00:29:41
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Yes, sorry.",00:29:45
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,"Two: on several of your daily logs, the paper clip was installed back to front, which led to a confusion as to where in the document to begin reading. Here are the incidents. But the bulk of our day will revolve around the following. You brought in a new refining team for Mark S. which failed to coalesce. You instituted kindness reforms.",00:29:46
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,Because I'm not Harmony Cobel.,00:30:16
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,"Kindness reforms that seemed to have, in no way, deterred curiosity or idling by the team once they returned. You arranged an outdoor retreat and team-building occurrence which resulted in the termination of one employee, and the discovery of the true identity of another at great risk and harm to the Eagan name. Look, Seth, Mark Scout's completion of Cold Harbor… will be remembered as one of the greatest moments in the history of this planet. It will take place under your stewardship. That's quite a legacy you will leave.",00:30:18
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Thank you, Mr. Drummond. That means a great deal.",00:31:17
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Drummond,"This milestone seems to have clouded your judgment. I think it's time to go back to the basics, Seth. To remember these severed workers' greater purpose… and to treat them as what they really are.",00:31:24
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,I'm tightening the leash.,00:32:30
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Hi, Mark.",00:32:53
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Mr. Milchick.,00:32:54
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,I see you left work six minutes early. May I come in? How was the rest of the funeral? Did you get what you needed from it?,00:32:56
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, sure. Hey, did Miss Huang take notes? I can't wait to read her article about it in that newspaper you showed me. What was it called again? The Bullshit Gazette?",00:33:14
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Hopefully, now we can put all this grief and tumult behind us and look forward to some productive workdays ahead.",00:33:33
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,You mean putting the numbers in the thing–,00:33:40
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,Refining.,00:33:44
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Right.,00:33:44
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,Yes. Does that sound good?,00:33:45
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Whatever you say, Mr. Milchick. Praise Kier.",00:33:47
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,Did you and Helly R. catch up?,00:34:00
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,We did.,00:34:04
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Milchick,"Did you tell her that you fucked her outie at the ORTBO? Helena Eagan, leader-in-waiting of this company. Have a restful evening.",00:34:05
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,"“The workers were diligent, focused on the task at hand. Pleasantly surprised, I noticed that not a single worker had a watch. They simply referenced a large standard clock near the door, just hands and numbers and cogs and purpose. Your sovereign boss may own the clock that greets you from the wall, but you get to enjoy its ticking and thus should be happy.”",00:34:51
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ricken,Yes.,00:35:20
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,"Babe, it's the literal opposite of what you were saying before.",00:35:21
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ricken,Okay. I see how you'd feel that way. But one point that Nat made was–,00:35:26
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,"Nat, okay.",00:35:33
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ricken,"She said that innies tend to thrive in an environment of structure, and once that is established, then they are more open to self-expansion. So I am just trying to speak their language.",00:35:36
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,"I know, but this sounds like Lumon's language.",00:35:47
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ricken,"Well, it's a Trojan's horse. If I can get my ideas to severed workers all across the world, it might beget a revolution.",00:35:50
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,"But these aren't your ideas. These are not your ideas, and also… Whatever.",00:35:59
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ricken,And what?,00:36:06
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,"Okay, Lumon hurts people, you know that, and if you want to water down your work so they can use it for their fucking propaganda, then you're hurting people too.",00:36:07
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ricken,Okay. I will reflect on your words.,00:36:14
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,Thank you.,00:36:17
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ricken,"And also, this is a fiscal and creative opportunity unlike any I have yet seen. And I'm not inclined to just walk away from it. Unless me selling millions of copies of my book and the life that that manages to give us has somehow lost its appeal for you.",00:36:20
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,Okay. Whatever. I'm gonna go to bed.,00:36:47
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ricken,No. Babe.,00:36:50
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Devon,"No, thank you.",00:36:52
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,"It's me again. So, they fired me. I think they knew what my innie was up to. I'm telling you to– I have to go.",00:37:52
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,Hey! Hey! You. Why are you following me?,00:38:14
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,"I got this thing. When somebody shows up on my doorstep screaming my name, I wanna know why. Call it a quirk.",00:38:26
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,You're with Lumon.,00:38:37
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,Why were you at my house the other night?,00:38:43
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,I don't know.,00:38:49
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,"It wasn't you at all, was it? You're severed. I got canned a couple of weeks ago. When I pressed them for a reason, they said my innie had an unsanctioned, erotic entanglement with another worker. They wouldn't tell me who. Then you show up at my door.",00:38:51
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,You think we were an item?,00:39:22
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,"Well, Fields certainly thinks so. We had to cancel our trip to Milwaukee. Thanks for that.",00:39:24
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,Fields?,00:39:31
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,"That's my husband, Fields.",00:39:31
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,I'm sorry.,00:39:35
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,"Yeah, well…",00:39:37
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,And I'm sorry I came at you just now.,00:39:38
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,It's fine. Maybe you could– I don't know.,00:39:44
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,What?,00:39:54
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,"We got a ham. We're planning to have it tomorrow. Might be nice if you come over. We could sit down, talk through it all.",00:39:57
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,"You, me, and…",00:40:08
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,Fields.,00:40:11
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,I suppose.,00:40:17
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,Great. We like red wine. Expensive.,00:40:19
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,Okay. Tomorrow.,00:40:24
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,You need a lift?,00:40:28
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,I'll walk. Thanks.,00:40:30
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Burt,You sure? I know where you live. See you tomorrow.,00:40:32
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Irving,Yes.,00:40:41
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Sorry there wasn't any eggnog. Might be out of season. What the fuck are you doing?,00:41:19
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,I needed some pressure points. Things to rattle your memories. Knitting?,00:41:27
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. She said it gave her time to think.,00:41:31
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,That her?,00:41:39
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,What I thought was her. She's not dead. She's just not here. Who's in there?,00:41:42
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,"They know people at the morgue. On the payroll, like everywhere else in Kier. You feel all right?",00:42:00
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"Basically. So, are we gonna…",00:42:13
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,One more day. Usually that's best.,00:42:16
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Usually? You've done this once.,00:42:22
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,"I don't wanna rush things. There's risk. It's not an exact science, Mark.",00:42:24
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,"I'm not sure it's science, period, but okay. You good on snacks?",00:42:28
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,For now.,00:42:37
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,Are they hurting her?,00:42:58
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,I don't know.,00:43:04
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Your outie.,00:43:15
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Mark,What?,00:43:16
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Reghabi,I didn't say anything.,00:43:18
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Your outie can parallel park in less than 20 seconds.,00:43:29
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Your outie can roller-skate with grace.,00:43:45
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Your outie pays all of his gas and electric bills within three business days.,00:43:54
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"Your outie listens to music while shaving, but not while showering.",00:44:20
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Casey,"Your outie prefers two scoops of ice cream in a serving, but they must be the same flavor.",00:44:35
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Your outie once captured a butterfly.,00:44:50
2,9,Trojan's Horse (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Your outie is going to–,00:45:03
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"There was this gray hall, but then…everything was, like, so white.",00:00:07
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,We're making progress. It's not just waking up on a table. It's human interaction.,00:00:21
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"This didn't feel human, this felt like a nightmare.",00:00:28
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"I mean, why is she rattling off a bunch of facts? What are they doing to her?",00:00:31
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,All I know is she's essential.,00:00:38
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,She didn't even recognize me.,00:00:44
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,The Gemma you know is still in there.,00:00:50
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,"And when you get her out, it will be the two of you out here together.",00:00:55
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Bargaining. You know what that is?,00:01:12
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,What do you mean?,00:01:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Well, it's one of the stages.",00:01:20
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"You think about all the things you'd do, and all the ways you'd change to get that person back. You'd drink less. You'd listen more. It's dumb, but you do it anyway.",00:01:24
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,It's normal.,00:01:49
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah. But for me, it might actually happen.",00:01:51
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"It was a sketch of a black hallway,",00:02:05
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,with a black elevator that only goes down.,00:02:07
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,So there's a floor beneath us.,00:02:14
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,That must be where they're keeping her.,00:02:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,There were directions on the back.,00:02:17
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,"Well, let's see it.",00:02:20
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"I left it there, behind the poster.",00:02:23
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Why didn't you just take it?,00:02:26
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"I just didn't, okay? I don't wanna get in trouble right now.",00:02:28
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,"Okay. Well, I don't give a shit about that, so I'll go get it.",00:02:31
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,You said it's behind the poster of you actually being brave?,00:02:33
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"Okay, yeah. Fuck you. You don't know everything.",00:02:35
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Then tell us.,00:02:37
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,It's okay.,00:02:40
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,"Okay. Well, I still have a hall pass, so I can go to the break room now, and then we can start after lunch.",00:02:51
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. Maybe.,00:02:54
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Maybe?,00:02:56
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Did everyone sever their balls in the elevator this morning?,00:02:57
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,I'm starving.,00:02:59
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Mark? Are you okay?,00:03:25
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,Sir?,00:05:03
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,Have a seat.,00:05:06
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,I had my performance review yesterday.,00:05:15
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,How did it go?,00:05:20
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,"Many valid concerns were raised, which I look forward to addressing.",00:05:30
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,I'm glad for you.,00:05:35
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,"I feel I should remind you, you cannot graduate from this fellowship until I have deemed you Wintertide material. This will mean using your time well, focusing on your own duties, and eradicating from your essence childish folly.",00:05:46
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,"I understand, sir.",00:06:11
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,I shall be busy for the rest of the day. I trust you can steward the floor in my stead?,00:06:15
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,Of course.,00:06:22
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,Good. You may sit at your regular desk.,00:06:22
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,"Thank you, Mr. Milchick.",00:06:32
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,He threatened you?,00:06:49
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,As I was leaving.,00:06:49
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,In the elevator.,00:06:51
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,They're trying to intimidate us. Divide us.,00:06:52
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,And also–,00:06:53
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,"It's so that we won't work together, because they know what will happen if we do. I'm gonna go get that map.",00:06:55
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Helly, we shared vessels.",00:06:59
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,What's that?,00:07:03
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Well, we…we had sex.",00:07:06
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,"Okay. You and… Like, in a Wellness session?",00:07:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,No. Not… Ms. Casey. It was at the retreat. In your tent. Yeah.,00:07:26
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,You mean…,00:07:48
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"I mean, obviously, you know, I thought it was you. 'Cause, you know, I've been having those feelings since, like, before the OTC. So when she… I just… I had no idea, okay?",00:07:53
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Uh-huh.,00:08:11
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"I'm sorry, Helly. I… She tricked me. I mean, I… you know, wanted to, but she…she tricked both of us.",00:08:11
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,It's probably another tactic. Something to drive a wedge between us. Like–,00:08:25
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Helly–,00:08:31
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,I'm gonna go for a walk.,00:08:32
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Helly, I'm sorry. I thought it was you.",00:08:37
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,"But it wasn't me. Yeah, I'm just gonna go walk around.",00:08:41
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"First date, let me guess. Scuba.",00:10:03
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,Thai food.,00:10:06
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,Nice.,00:10:08
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,Though you did take scuba lessons last year.,00:10:09
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,Yeah? Which sea?,00:10:12
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,It was in a pool.,00:10:14
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,Okay. Cool.,00:10:15
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,"It was a little expensive. You've had a lot of phases. Scuba diving, woodworking.",00:10:18
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"Wow. So, my outie's really diverse.",00:10:28
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,Garage beer-making.,00:10:30
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"Maybe I'm trying to find something I excel in up there, like I do down here.",00:10:34
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,I sometimes wonder if you're just not happy.,00:10:44
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"I'm sure it's not that. 'Cause, like, you know… I mean, here, with you, I'm super happy. I just, like, wanna hear about all my offspring and stare at your face.",00:10:48
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,Sorry. That was weird.,00:11:08
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,No. It was really sweet. I like it. I like this.,00:11:08
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"I wish we could really be together. Like, all the time.",00:11:21
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,"I mean, we are. Aren't we?",00:11:28
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,You and him are. But I'm not.,00:11:35
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,Is it okay if we try the hug again? I kind of like the hugging.,00:11:53
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, hey. I was coming to find you.",00:13:53
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Same.,00:13:55
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Look, I am so sorry. I can't even imagine what it must be like to–",00:13:58
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,You thought it was me.,00:14:04
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Hundred percent.,00:14:07
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Which means you wanted to. With me.,00:14:08
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Yeah.,00:14:13
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,"What sucks is that she got to have that, and I didn't. That she used me to trick my friends. Used my body to get close to you. That she dresses me in the morning like I'm a baby. That she controls me, and this company, and all of us. It's disgusting.",00:14:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Hey, do you want me to, like, describe what happened? Like, I feel like you have every right to know.",00:14:49
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,No. I don't want her memory.,00:14:56
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:14:59
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,I want my own. Would you like that?,00:15:03
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, I'd like that. But how?",00:15:18
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Ta-da. A tent.,00:16:18
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,I'm nervous.,00:16:48
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Me too.,00:16:51
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,You too.,00:16:54
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,It's okay.,00:16:54
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Okay.,00:16:55
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Wait.,00:17:43
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Yes?,00:18:00
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Yes.,00:18:03
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,You must eradicate from your essence childish folly.,00:19:30
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,You must eradicate from yourself childish folly.,00:19:39
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,You must abandon childish things.,00:19:57
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,You must grow up.,00:20:03
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,You must grow up. Grow up.,00:20:07
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,Grow up.,00:20:13
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,Grow up.,00:20:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,Grow.,00:20:20
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Milchick,Grow. Grow. Grow. Grow.,00:20:22
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Was it different with me?,00:20:56
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, no, you're bleeding.",00:21:10
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,"No, you are.",00:21:15
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,You have two minutes left. Humidity on the severed floor is maintained at a consistent 45%. It must be something else. Did you punch him?,00:21:23
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,"I mean, not today.",00:21:39
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,What were you doing when the nosebleed occurred?,00:21:40
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,We were refining something.,00:21:44
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,Do you have a deviated septum?,00:21:50
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Well, I don't know what that is.",00:21:52
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,Would you like me to put petroleum jelly in your nostrils?,00:21:55
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"No, thanks.",00:21:58
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,Any other symptoms? Any auras or hallucinations?,00:22:00
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,No. I think it stopped. I feel better.,00:22:07
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,I'm going to take your blood pressure.,00:22:12
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,Where are you?,00:22:21
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,I'm at Lumon.,00:22:23
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,What?,00:22:29
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,What?,00:22:29
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Fuck. I was just–,00:22:35
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Miss Huang,Mark?,00:22:35
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Wha–,00:22:40
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,Were you just at Lumon?,00:22:42
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,What time is it?,00:22:43
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,Are you at Lumon or in your basement with me?,00:22:45
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,I don't know.,00:22:47
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,Do you remember a hallway? A black hallway?,00:22:50
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,I remember… Okay. I remember a desk. I remember a desk. I remember… Shit.,00:22:52
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,That was another crossover memory. A recent one. That's good. You'll feel gaps in time until it all comes back together.,00:23:12
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Well, when the fuck is that gonna happen?",00:23:20
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,We need to enhance. Speed up the process.,00:23:25
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Is that safe?,00:23:29
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,There's a slight chance of hemorrhage.,00:23:31
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Okay. So, me bleeding to death.",00:23:34
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,Not necessarily. We'll flood the chip itself.,00:23:39
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Flood the chip?,00:23:44
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,Through the hole in your head.,00:23:46
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Jesus Christ.,00:23:46
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,That you've already got.,00:23:49
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Okay–You know what? Get the fuck off me. I am not doing this, okay?",00:23:49
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,We're close. It's happening.,00:23:54
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Get this shit off right now! Please.,00:23:56
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,We need to push!,00:23:56
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Get it off–God. I'm fu… I'm starving.,00:23:58
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,That's also from reintegration.,00:24:02
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go eat.",00:24:04
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,Fuck.,00:24:13
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,Hello.,00:24:53
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,Who the hell are you?,00:24:56
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,It's a joke. Come on in. Hey.,00:25:00
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,Okay. What the heck?,00:25:03
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,Fields is tending the ham. I hope you like a cumin glaze.,00:25:10
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,"Yes, of course.",00:25:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,Do you not?,00:25:18
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,"No, I do.",00:25:18
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Attila.,00:25:20
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"Yes, Attila?",00:25:21
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Did you just ask about the glaze?,00:25:22
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,I did.,00:25:24
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,"Well, don't. I've already put it on.",00:25:24
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,I was gonna say we also have corn.,00:25:29
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,"Oh, yes. We could feed him a pile of loose corn.",00:25:32
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,What your innie ever saw in this Philistine is beyond me.,00:25:40
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,"Fields, I presume.",00:25:49
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Yes.,00:25:51
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,Irving.,00:25:52
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Irving.,00:25:52
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,Yes.,00:25:54
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Welcome back to our home.,00:25:55
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,Yes. I'm sorry about the last time. I'm sure that felt quite invasive.,00:25:57
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Nonsense. What's mine's yours. And you've brought wine.,00:26:06
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"Irving, no one's ever thrown blood on you on your way into work?",00:26:17
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,No.,00:26:22
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,It wasn't blood. It was paint.,00:26:22
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,Meant to evoke blood.,00:26:25
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Not what you said.,00:26:26
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"The Whole Mind people are off the deep end, is my point.",00:26:27
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,"And, Burt, how did you come to be at the company?",00:26:32
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,Me?,00:26:36
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,"Yes, I'm very curious.",00:26:36
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"Well, as a matter of fact, I was guided to Lumon's door by Jesus.",00:26:38
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,Oh. Jesus Christ?,00:26:47
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,That's the one.,00:26:51
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,"You should just leave it at that, and let him wonder what the hell you meant.",00:26:54
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"No, we'd been attending the Lutheran church for some years. And I should mention that I'd been what you might call a scoundrel in my younger days.",00:26:58
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,To put it mildly.,00:27:08
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"So, one Sunday at breakfast, Fields asked me point blank, do I think I'm going to heaven?",00:27:11
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,As one asks at breakfast.,00:27:18
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"I pretend to think about it, but I know the answer is no.",00:27:21
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,"To which I replied, “What am I supposed to do up there for eternity all by myself?”",00:27:27
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,I see.,00:27:33
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"So we hop on the train to church, and it so happens the sermon that day is about severance…",00:27:33
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Yeah.,00:27:40
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,…which was still very new at the time. And the pastor says–,00:27:40
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,"As if he'd been listening to our conversation, he said the church's stance is that innies are, you know, complete individuals, with souls…that can be judged separately from their outie.",00:27:44
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,"So, an innie can go to heaven.",00:28:07
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,Whilst the outie burns.,00:28:11
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,"We're not zealots, I swear. But we figured that if it were true, it may be a way for part of Burt to–You know…",00:28:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,Wow.,00:28:34
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,He's looking for the exit.,00:28:38
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,"No, it's just–So, the hope was for Burt's innie to go to heaven.",00:28:38
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Yes. With me.,00:28:48
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"Gretch, it's the end of the month. Those salesmen are just dying to hit their numbers and get cars off the lot. They'll basically be giving me money.",00:29:35
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,Okay. Fine. Just test drive only. I won't commit to anything.,00:29:47
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,Thank you.,00:29:53
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Merrick,No.,00:29:53
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,"You didn't tell me how'd it go. You went back to Lumon, right?",00:29:58
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Merrick,No.,00:30:05
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,That good?,00:30:07
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,They canceled it. I didn't see him… you.,00:30:11
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,Happy plate.,00:30:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Jim,Happy plate.,00:30:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,Happy plate. Go play with your sister.,00:30:18
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,Canceled it? What happened?,00:30:20
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Gretchen,They didn't say. Guess you got too busy.,00:30:22
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Dylan,Hey. Buddy. Try it. No. Okay.,00:30:28
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Merrick,No.,00:30:28
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,Thank you.,00:31:02
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,Mark Scout. Thought that was you. I'm Helena Eagan. I work at Lumon.,00:31:44
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah. No, I know who you are.",00:31:52
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Well, it's nice to officially meet you. Have you had enough to eat?",00:31:59
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah, quite possibly.",00:32:13
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,I hope they're feeding you at work. May I?,00:32:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Please.,00:32:21
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"It's really great to run into you. I've heard nothing but good things about your work, by the way.",00:32:28
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Thank you. I've heard nothing at all about my work, so…",00:32:32
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,Severance humor. That's so clever.,00:32:36
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,And so easy.,00:32:39
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Look, I'm sorry for the systemic error from the other night.",00:32:43
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,The systemic error? You mean the overtime thing?,00:32:49
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Yes. The OTC. It never should have happened, and it never will again. We take pride as a company to be better than that, and we will be better.",00:32:55
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Well, that's nice to hear. Thanks.",00:33:10
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,Of course.,00:33:10
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"So, you know all about it then.",00:33:18
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Yes, I know all about it. I'm, like, the head of the company, Mark.",00:33:21
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Right. Dumb. Sorry.,00:33:29
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Yeah, you should be sorry.",00:33:32
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Really? Okay.,00:33:34
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,I'm kidding. You're clearly not dumb.,00:33:34
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,I don't know. You…You're the one who invented a revolutionary medical procedure.,00:33:38
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Hey, now, that was not me. That was my father.",00:33:42
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Uh-huh.,00:33:45
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,You should meet him sometime.,00:33:48
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Your father?,00:33:51
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,Sure. Why not?,00:33:53
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,You wanna take me home to Dad already?,00:33:54
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Yeah, I think it's finally time.",00:33:57
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Okay. Sure. Let's do it.,00:33:58
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,You'd be the first.,00:34:02
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"So, no pressure.",00:34:04
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Yeah. None whatsoever. But seriously, I'd love to hear about your experiences sometime.",00:34:04
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Okay. Yeah. About severance?,00:34:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,I meant the overtime con…I meant the other night.,00:34:20
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"I mean, I can't imagine how confusing that must have been. Traumatic, even. And I know you've already been through so much with losing your wife and all. Hanna.",00:34:26
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Gemma.,00:34:46
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Right. Gemma. Sorry. It was a car accident, right?",00:34:49
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,That's right.,00:34:57
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Yeah, such a shame. She was so young.",00:35:00
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Thank you.,00:35:11
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,Are you all right?,00:35:23
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,I'm fine. I'm just about finished here.,00:35:25
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,Okay. Right.,00:35:27
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Well, it was nice to meet you, Helena.",00:35:32
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,"Yeah. You too, Mark.",00:35:36
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helena,What is it?,00:35:52
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Nothing. Good night.,00:35:56
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"We used to call each other hon, then about ten years ago that became Attila.",00:37:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Because… Do you know history?,00:37:22
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,Yeah.,00:37:25
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,He knows history.,00:37:25
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,And it wasn't ten years ago. It was 20.,00:37:30
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,No.,00:37:32
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Yes! Because I remember we were having drinks with your Lumon partner. Quite startled him.,00:37:32
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,Didn't the first severed office open 12 years ago?,00:37:48
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"Yes, it did.",00:37:51
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Yeah.,00:37:51
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,Maybe that's enough of that.,00:37:54
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,You know the corn is very special.,00:38:12
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,Do you think you two ever made love at work?,00:38:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"Fields, Jesus.",00:38:18
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,"Can we not just be pragmatic adults about this? There is a nonzero chance that the two of you had unprotected sex. And so, I felt the right to ask.",00:38:21
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,Are you done humiliating our guest?,00:38:42
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Fields,"Sounds like I'm mad, but I'm not. Cards on the table. I've been talking to Pastor Gale about this, and I believe that innies deserve to experience love. I mean it. And I hope it was beautiful.",00:38:47
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Sorry for being a dick. Let's do it. Tonight.,00:39:33
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,There.,00:42:36
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,How long will it take?,00:42:40
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,It'll be fast.,00:42:41
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Fast. How fast?,00:42:44
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,I'm nervous.,00:42:57
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Helly,Yes.,00:43:00
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,What the fuck?,00:43:16
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,Don't move like that. You have to keep your head still.,00:43:17
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,Ignore it. Tell me–,00:43:27
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,Mark?,00:43:33
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,My car's in the driveway. She knows I'm here.,00:43:36
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,No…,00:43:37
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,Mark.,00:43:45
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Yeah? Hey.,00:43:45
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,"Dude, I left you, like, five messages. Are you better?",00:43:51
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"No, I'm still sick.",00:43:54
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,"Well, you can't not pick up when we're doing corporate espionage shit. The floodlight thing was a bust, right? Because I have had an idea that is a little dumber.",00:43:56
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, Devon…",00:44:03
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,"Do you remember the rich lady from baby camp? The one I, like, kind of had a crush on? I was thinking–",00:44:04
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah. Look, I'm already trying something else.",00:44:08
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,Okay. What are you trying?,00:44:14
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,Just don't worry about it.,00:44:17
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,What the fuck does that mean?,00:44:20
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,I'm doing it myself.,00:44:20
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,Fuck that. Why are you trying to cut me out of this?,00:44:24
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Shit. I'm really not, Devon.",00:44:29
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,You literally are.,00:44:33
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,"Okay, fine. I am, but I didn't ask for your help!",00:44:33
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,"Fuck you, officially.",00:44:38
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Mark,And what is that smell?,00:44:39
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,What smell?,00:44:43
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, my God. Mark.",00:45:05
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Reghabi,Don't touch him.,00:45:13
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Devon,Who the fuck are you?,00:45:14

2,9,Attila (Transcript),Irving,Thank you for the spare ham. Is Fields…,00:45:29
2,9,Attila (Transcript),Burt,"He's fine. He'll be embarrassed tomorrow. You know, he gets fuzzy. Like saying I worked at Lumon 20 years ago, which is, of course, before severance even existed.",00:45:33

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Okay. How long?,00:03:51
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,Hard to say. We'll need some equipment from downstairs. Are you clumsy?,00:03:52
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,What? Why do you have equipment in Mark's basement?,00:03:57
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,Your brother's reintegrating.,00:04:00
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"No, he's not.",00:04:03
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,I know that was troubling.,00:04:05
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"Okay. I can tell that you're smarter than me, so forgive me if I say this, like, super plainly, but if you give one solitary thought to messing with my brother again, I will throw you off a fucking bridge.",00:04:06
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,Devon–,00:04:16
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,We don't do that again.,00:04:16
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,We'll discuss it later.,00:04:18

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,It's what he wants.,00:04:27

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,No. That's… It's okay. I just… I brought you something.,00:13:19
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,It's an ant farm. Last night you said you liked ants. So…,00:13:25
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,I said I liked… I like plants.,00:13:33
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Plants.,00:13:36

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ricken,"It really, truly wasn't that bad.",00:15:32
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,For you. That's 'cause you can scale walls like a gecko. This… It was like half a mile of just exposed rock face.,00:15:34
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ricken,Boulders. Fine.,00:15:40
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,It sounds fun.,00:15:40
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ricken,There were a few boulders.,00:15:41
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"Boulders? Babe, come on. It was like the death zone of Everest.",00:15:43
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Like Chomolungma.,00:15:46
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Any frozen bodies?,00:15:47
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"No, I looked. But I do have photo evidence. Look at them.",00:15:49

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,That sounds painful.,00:16:01
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,We all know what that means.,00:16:01
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,I'm sorry he said that.,00:16:03
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ricken,Outdoorsmanship courses through my veins.,00:16:04
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,I think it's hot.,00:16:06
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ricken,I make no apology for it.,00:16:06
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,"Wait, how did you get down?",00:16:07
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,I scooted on my ass.,00:16:09
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Are there photos of that?,00:16:09
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,No. It was a no-photo zone.,00:16:11
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,A no-photo death zone.,00:16:12
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Exactly. Thank you.,00:16:14
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ricken,You and I will ramble together someday. The two of us. It will be a grand adventure.,00:16:16
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,I feel like we spend a lot of time together.,00:16:19
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ricken,"Not enough. No, Mark.",00:16:21
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Really?,00:16:21

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ricken,…drinkable water?,00:16:27
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Why would I do that?,00:16:28
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ricken,To experience the beauty and wonder of nature.,00:16:30
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,But why is it you want to do this so bad?,00:16:32
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Okay.,00:16:34
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ricken,I want to know you better.,00:16:34
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Why is it you need to have me come with you…,00:16:36

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Locked and loaded.,00:22:37
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Third time's the charm.,00:22:38
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,That's what they say.,00:22:40
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,I'll write you a thank-you note.,00:22:41
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,You hate writing thank-you notes.,00:22:43
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,"Oh, my God. I'm a little nervous.",00:22:47
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Baby?,00:22:50
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Hmm.,00:22:50
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,I said I'm a little nervous.,00:22:51
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, yeah. Well, you know, it's the final step and, you know, there's a kid that's out there just waiting for us. Just got to reach out and grab her. Right?",00:22:53
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,What if it doesn't work?,00:23:07
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Turn around and bend over.,00:23:08

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,And what happened in the rooms? You remember nothing?,00:24:23
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Nothing.,00:24:29
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,How did you feel in the hall? Did you exit any of the rooms feeling despair? Fervor? Gaiety?,00:24:38
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,"There's only one room I haven't been to yet, and today it had a name on it.",00:24:51
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,Cold Harbor.,00:24:59

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,"So, I'll see Mark?",00:25:20

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Can you please just talk like a normal person?,00:25:38
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,"Good night, Gemma. Dream sweet.",00:25:48
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,"Gemma, coffee's ready!",00:26:14
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Is he okay?,00:26:35
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,He's stable. It was an isolated event. He's journeying now.,00:26:36
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,When will he wake up?,00:26:42
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,When he's ready to.,00:26:43
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Great. You really think this is gonna work?,00:26:45
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,There's no other choice.,00:26:52
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,There's an innie cabin.,00:27:00
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,Come again?,00:27:02
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"There… I mean, it's technically… It's a cottage where severed people become their innies, and there was this woman–",00:27:04

2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"Well, so maybe if we go to the cabin, we could talk to his innie, and he could–",00:27:12
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,They're two completely different things. This is how you get Gemma out.,00:27:15
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"Really, this? Because this looks like how you kill my brother.",00:27:20
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,You two are definitely related.,00:27:24
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,I could call her.,00:27:35
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,Who?,00:27:35
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Harmony Cobel.,00:27:37
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,What? Why would you do that? She runs the severed floor.,00:27:39
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"Not anymore, she doesn't. She might know how to get in the cabin. And, fuck, she might know how to get to Gemma.",00:27:41
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,She's Lumon through and through. She was raised by them. She's a soldier.,00:27:46
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,It's a risk. I get that.,00:27:50
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,A risk?,00:27:50
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Yeah.,00:27:52
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,"She will turn you over to them. Both of us. Everything I've done to fight, gone. We resume the treatment as soon as he wakes up.",00:27:55
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Okay. I have custody of his brain now. You don't. I'm calling her.,00:28:01
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,"Well, then, I can't be a part of this.",00:28:18
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,What?,00:28:18
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,If you do that… If you make that choice…,00:28:21
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"What are you… No, seriously, what are you doing?",00:28:24
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,Good luck.,00:28:25
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"You can't leave him like this. No, no, no, I can't do this without you. You… Are you kidding? You're leaving now?",00:28:25
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,This… This isn't my choice. It's yours.,00:28:36
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"No, I need you to stay. I can't… I don't know what to do with this. What do I do if he wakes up?",00:28:40
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Reghabi,Do not call that woman.,00:28:44
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, my God.",00:28:46
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Hey.,00:28:59
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Chi…,00:29:01
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Mark?,00:29:03
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Chikha… Chikha…,00:29:03
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,What are you trying to say?,00:29:07
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Chikhai… Chik…,00:29:11
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Chikhai bardo?,00:29:13
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,I don't know. It looks like two guys fighting.,00:29:14
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,"No, it's the same guy fighting himself, defeating his own psyche. Ego death.",00:29:18
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,How do you know it's the same guy?,00:29:24
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,"Well, the hair's the same.",00:29:26
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,That thing came in the mail?,00:29:30
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Yeah. It's one of those things where you have to draw a duck or a rabbit or whatever. I think I got onto the mailing list at the clinic.,00:29:32
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Why are you wasting your time with this?,00:29:42
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Why are you being an asshole?,00:29:47
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,I'm not. I'm just… I don't know. It seems kind of… weird.,00:29:49
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,"I'm enjoying this. Or was, until you ruined it.",00:29:56
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,"I think you might be overreacting a little bit, Gemma.",00:29:59
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Don't do that.,00:30:02
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Do what?,00:30:04
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Tell me how I'm feeling.,00:30:06
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,I have no idea how you're feeling.,00:30:06
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Like shit. Beat to shit.,00:30:09
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,So let's stop.,00:30:12
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,It's okay. This is perfectly normal. Let's get you set up with that meal. Bon appétit. Can I get you anything else? Coffee? Tea? Another pillow…,00:31:28
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,He's stuck at 96%.,00:31:47
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Drummond,"The nose bleeds set us back. When he's done, you're gonna have to say goodbye to her.",00:31:50
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,I'm aware.,00:32:00
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Drummond,For Kier.,00:32:05
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,For Kier.,00:32:12
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Drummond,Why are you wearing that stupid sweater?,00:32:19
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,"Dear Mr. Tisdale, I cannot thank you enough… for the thoughtful Christmas gift you sent my husband and I this year. We have never owned an electric grouter. And we look forward to the many happy memories it will provide.",00:32:53
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,"Come on now, sweetheart. It's the last one.",00:33:49
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Nothing… says… Christmas like… grouting.,00:34:03
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,"It's actually a de-grouter, but close enough.",00:34:16
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,How much longer do I have to do this?,00:34:26
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,"I told you, you're done. But Christmas has a funny way of coming back around each year.",00:34:29
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,It's always Christmas.,00:34:44
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,Let's go.,00:34:50
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,I love you.,00:35:03
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,"I said, “I love you.”",00:35:10
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,I love you too.,00:35:18
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,"Hello, Gemma.",00:37:34
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Dr. Mauer.,00:37:36
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,How are you feeling?,00:37:38
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,My hand hurts.,00:37:42
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,And what room caused your hand to hurt?,00:37:45
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Allentown. I want to go home.,00:37:52
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,Your husband remarried last year… and he has a daughter now.,00:38:17
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,I don't believe you.,00:38:30
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,"You've been gone a long time, Gemma. He's moved on. Maybe you've moved on too. In one of the rooms. What do you think? Do you feel yourself gravitating towards one room or another? Maybe you felt things behind those doors you never felt with Mark. Maybe I've seen it.",00:38:32
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mauer,The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Let me guess. He dies at the end.,00:39:08
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Nurse,Gemma!,00:40:53
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Nurse,Gemma! Stop!,00:41:01
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Nurse,Gemma!,00:41:04
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Hey.,00:41:22
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,You sure you don't want to come?,00:41:23
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,It's charades.,00:41:26
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,"That's gonna be, like, 20 minutes of it.",00:41:26
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,"Yeah. But, you know.",00:41:29
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Or I could stay?,00:41:32
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,"No, you should probably go. I mean, this thing's gotta be in tonight anyway, so…",00:41:34
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Okay. Did you get the Denali thing I sent?,00:41:40
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,The… No. I'll look at it. I'll check it out.,00:41:44
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,"All right. Well, I'll be back at, like, 10:00.",00:41:49
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:41:52
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,I love you. I said–,00:41:54
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, no, I love you too, hon. I'm sorry.",00:42:04
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Bye.,00:42:04
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Mark,See you.,00:42:05
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Milchick,Ms. Casey.,00:42:46
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Mr. Milchick.,00:42:50
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Milchick,I'm so sorry.,00:42:52
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ms. Casey,What's happening?,00:42:56
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Milchick,Nothing. Your outie came in for a public art exhibition and found herself in the wrong elevator.,00:42:57
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ms. Casey,How long have I been–,00:43:10
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Milchick,"If you wouldn't mind turning around and heading back in, it would be greatly appreciated.",00:43:12
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ms. Casey,But–,00:43:18
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Milchick,On you go.,00:43:18
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Ms. Casey,Where's–,00:43:36
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Milchick,"Thank you, Ms. Casey.",00:43:36
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,No.,00:45:08
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Mark.,00:46:28
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Nurse,Come on.,00:46:33
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Gemma,Mark.,00:46:33
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"Mark? Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hi. Hey.",00:47:27
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Careful. Easy.,00:47:50
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,"Oh, Mark.",00:47:59
2,9,Chikhai Bardo (Transcript),Devon,Where'd you go?,00:48:02
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Magnus,You hear about that clusterfuck up on North Pine?,00:04:23
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Dutch Stevens' kid.,00:04:26
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Magnus,How the fuck do you flip a two-ton snow plow?,00:04:28
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,With stupidity. The apple don't fall far from the gutter.,00:04:31
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Magnus,"Well, that's kind of you.",00:04:36
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,On the house.,00:04:38
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Magnus,Thank you.,00:04:40
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,"Hey, Rose. You want a refill?",00:04:44
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Rose,You can top me off anytime.,00:04:50
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,I like the new do. Très chic.,00:04:54
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,"Harmony Cobel. Well, flip my toboggan.",00:06:04
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,You want coffee?,00:06:19
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,No.,00:06:22
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Tables are for paying customers.,00:06:26
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Fine. Then buy me a coffee.,00:06:30
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,The town is older than I remember. Frailer.,00:06:41
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,"Yeah, well, with the market readjustment from a few years ago and the fluctuating interest rates, there was a retrenchment from some of the core infrastructure investments.",00:06:55
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I need a favor. But not here. Meet me at the factory.,00:07:14
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,"Hey, Dot. Close up for me.",00:07:43
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Dot,Sure.,00:07:43
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,You know how fucked it is to ask me to come here?,00:09:57
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I need you to drive me to Sissy's.,00:10:03
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,"No, thanks.",00:10:13
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,"If they're watching the house, they'll recognize my car.",00:10:18
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,How much trouble are you in?,00:10:25
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Enough.,00:10:31
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,You know she still lives by the nine?,00:10:41
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I assumed.,00:10:47
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Then you know she's a fucking pariah here.,00:10:49
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,You can stay in the truck. I need to get something.,00:10:53
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Why would I help you with anything?,00:11:04
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,We were once chums. Old colleagues lift each other up.,00:11:13
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Colleagues? Child fucking labor.,00:11:23
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,"Kier and Imogene met at the Ether Mill, you know that?",00:11:37
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Was she hacking up a lung at the time?,00:11:47
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I can smell it on your breath. Pathetic.,00:11:51
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Fuck you.,00:11:54
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,You can help me or not. But I'll not be the punching dummy for your resentments.,00:11:56
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Coast is clear.,00:13:45
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,You're higher than a bearded vulture.,00:13:56
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Tell her to drop dead for me.,00:14:05
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,You are not welcome here. This is trespass. I have a mind to call the authorities. I do not want that huff peddler on my property.,00:14:18
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,You gave him his thirst for it.,00:14:35
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,You've a liar's mouth. Do you want to come down here and tell me what this is all about?,00:14:38
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,What have you done with my things?,00:15:14
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,Sold. To the poor.,00:15:18
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,They weren't yours to sell.,00:15:21
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,I sit in this house. You do not.,00:15:24
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Has anyone been here?,00:15:29
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,No one comes here.,00:15:32
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Or telephoned?,00:15:36
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,A Mr. Drummond.,00:15:43
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,And what did he want?,00:15:47
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,"What have you done, little mouse?",00:15:54
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,Harmony!,00:16:01
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I want the key to Mother's room.,00:16:03
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,That room stays shut until all who remember her sit with Kier. You know this.,00:16:05
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Give me the key.,00:16:11
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,Why do you bring nothing but woe into my life?,00:16:14
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,"No, it is you who cursed this house with woe.",00:16:18
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,I will not have this quarrel.,00:16:22
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,What were her last words?,00:16:28
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,"Child, do not test me.",00:16:31
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,What were they? She said nothing after you pulled the tube from her gullet.,00:16:35
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,There was gratitude in her eyes to be freed from her suffering. If only she had been a believer. Perhaps she would have found solace in the nine.,00:17:01
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,"You didn't have to listen to her wheezing as I did, day after day.",00:17:33
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,"I would have cared for her myself, had I not been at school.",00:17:44
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,Where you belonged.,00:17:51
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I didn't even get to say goodbye.,00:17:57
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,"Your studies were more important. Mr. Eagan saw Kier in you. He really did. And the Wintertide Fellowship. Even at the factory, no apprentice was more industrious than you. Such a disappointment you've proven to be.",00:18:02
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,What did Drummond tell you?,00:18:33
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,"Return and plead forgiveness, child. The Eagans will grant it.",00:18:39
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,"And show me mercy, just like you did with Mother.",00:18:47
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Where is the key?,00:19:00
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,All you will find in there is pain.,00:19:15
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Where is it?,00:19:52
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I found it!,00:20:11
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Come on.,00:20:22
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,Don't! Stand away!,00:24:06
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Get your harpy hands off me.,00:24:07
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,"You've no salutation here, you blighted snuff slave.",00:24:09
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,"All right, I missed you too. You smell like crow skin.",00:24:13
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,I'll phone somebody. I swear it!,00:24:15
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,"Yeah, call everyone. We'll have a fucking kegger.",00:24:16
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,This is a pure house.,00:24:19
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Back off or I'll put you in the bay!,00:24:20
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,What is it? What happened?,00:24:28
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Nothing. Came to get you. She's not too happy about it.,00:24:30
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Did you see something?,00:24:35
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,"No, but it's cold as shit in the truck, and I gotta get back.",00:24:36
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I have to find it.,00:24:42
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Find what?,00:24:44
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Just give me a minute just to think.,00:24:47
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,I liked her.,00:25:10
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,You barely knew her.,00:25:20
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,She hated Lumon more than I did. That's all I needed to know. At least she doesn't have to live with Sissy anymore.,00:25:25
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,You wanna get high?,00:26:08
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,"Wow. Oh, I haven't done that since I was eight.",00:27:26
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,You ready to man the vat for ten hours?,00:27:41
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,It's so shameful that you sell it.,00:27:55
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,I don't think it's here. What you're looking for.,00:28:40
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,Get out of here!,00:28:55
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,She wouldn't throw it away.,00:29:02
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Find it?,00:31:13
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Get the truck ready. And watch my head.,00:31:15
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I'm going. Don't tell them I was here.,00:31:28
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,I would never bear falsity to a steward of the Eagans.,00:31:31
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Lumon destroyed this town. You owe them no loyalty.,00:31:37
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,"There was no town before the factory. And what about your own employ? Everything that you have, you owe back to the Eagans as fealty.",00:31:44
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Fealty? Mine! My designs! Circuit blueprint… Base code… Overtime contingency… Glasgow block. All of it.,00:32:00
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,Jame Eagan was the inventor.,00:32:22
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,So I've heard.,00:32:25
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,Extraordinary. Why have you never spoken of this?,00:32:44
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,It was told Kier's knowledge is for all.,00:32:52
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,That is true.,00:32:57
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,"That if I sought credit, I would be banished.",00:33:00
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I hope you die as painfully as she did.,00:33:20
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,"It was her hand that removed the tube, not mine.",00:33:26
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,No!,00:33:30
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,Your mother was a coward. More sick in the soul than in the body. Filled with malice and resentment.,00:33:32
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,I don't believe you!,00:33:46
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Sissy,"I thought you were different… my flower. I tried to help you grow. But now I see you are a weed, just as she was.",00:33:50
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,Hey! Someone's comin'!,00:34:09
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,You better get going.,00:34:26
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Hampton.,00:34:35
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,I'll see you around.,00:34:36
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Hampton,"Come and tame these tempers, assholes.",00:34:56
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Devon,"Mrs. Selvig? Thank fuck, I've been trying to reach you.",00:35:11
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,"Yes, I'm aware.",00:35:14
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Devon,"So, listen, Mark has been reintegrating.",00:35:17
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Reghabi?,00:35:20
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Devon,Yeah.,00:35:22
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,And she hasn't killed him yet?,00:35:23
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Devon,"No. I mean, I think he's okay? But listen, we wanna try something else.",00:35:25
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Is Mark with you?,00:35:29
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Devon,Uh-huh. Yes.,00:35:32
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Put him on.,00:35:32
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Mark,Yeah. Hello?,00:35:37
2,9,Sweet Vitriol (Transcript),Harmony,Tell me everything.,00:35:40
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helena,Father.,00:01:17
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Jame,A momentous day.,00:01:20
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helena,Yes.,00:01:23
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Jame,Won't you eat? I'll watch.,00:01:29
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helena,We're seeing to Mr. Bailiff.,00:02:19
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Jame,I wish you'd take them raw.,00:02:31
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Unveil.,00:04:57

2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Ms. Huang,I thought I'd be finishing the quarter.,00:05:26
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,"Empathy awaits, fellow Huang. You may resume your duties for the day. A shuttle will pick you up at dusk. But first… lay the game on the table. The handbook requires that you mark this betterment with a material sacrifice. I have chosen your ring toss game as a proper totem.",00:05:30
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Again.,00:06:36
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Again.,00:06:43
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,Asher picked up the kids.,00:06:55
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,Outstanding.,00:06:57
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,I kissed your innie.,00:07:11
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,Beg pardon?,00:07:15
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,"I saw your innie again at Lumon. And right before I left, we ended up kissing for about a minute.",00:07:19
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,What?,00:07:40
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,I'm sorry.,00:07:42
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,How? What the fuck? Like…,00:07:49
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,It didn't f–,00:07:54
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,It didn't what? It didn't mean anything?,00:07:55
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,I wasn't going to say that.,00:08:00
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,Wow. Yeah.,00:08:04
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,You've been adrift. You know that.,00:08:07
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,This is so many fucking dimensions of fucked.,00:08:11
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,He just… He reminds me of how you used to be.,00:08:15
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,Okay.,00:08:19
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,Dylan?,00:08:19
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,I'm gonna go to work and earn a paycheck to feed our children.,00:08:20
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,Will you st–,00:08:25
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,And I'm gonna respectfully request that you don't follow me there and use my own body to fucking cheat on me.,00:08:25
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,Don't leave.,00:08:30
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,You know what? Since I would have no way of knowing if that's happening or not… I don't know. Maybe I just go quit. Maybe I go in and I quit and I just end his existence. How about that?,00:08:32
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Irving,Burt.,00:09:20
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,“They may be also connected to several recent disappearances or deaths. Goodman may have participated as a low-level Lumon enforcer or goon.”,00:09:28
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,“Lumon goon.” That stings. We never used words like that. With Lumon it's very specific language.,00:09:52
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Irving,That was before. I… I know now that I was wrong. I know you're not with them.,00:10:17
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,Would you go for a ride with me?,00:10:33
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Irving,"Burt, I'm sorry. I…",00:10:39
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,Go for a ride with me.,00:10:52
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,Yes?,00:11:28
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mauer,It's nine o'clock.,00:11:29
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,And?,00:11:29
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mauer,The numbers aren't moving.,00:11:31
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,The numbers aren't moving.,00:11:35
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,He may just be running late.,00:11:36
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,The final quota was promised today. Get him here now.,00:11:39
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,Hello? Mark?,00:12:01
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,Do you know where you are?,00:12:13
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,I'm fine.,00:12:13
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,All right. Where are you?,00:12:16
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,A smelly fucking car.,00:12:19
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,That's nice. And how about me? Am I me or a copy machine?,00:12:21
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"Tragically, you're you.",00:12:28
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,This is a mistake.,00:12:41
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,"I'm sorry. The wind was whistling over the hole in the back of your skull, so I didn't quite get that. Did you just call my plan a fucking mistake?",00:12:43
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,We told her everything. She told us shit. We can't trust her.,00:12:53
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,Yeah. This is it.,00:12:57
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,Looks like she's not here yet.,00:13:30
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"I mean, what if it's a trap?",00:13:41
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,"Maybe it is, I don't know. Maybe it's not. But we fucking need her.",00:13:43
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,Don't answer it.,00:13:58
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,Where's Mark?,00:14:14
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Excuse me?,00:14:14
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,This is the second day in a row he's not here. Is he coming in?,00:14:16
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Nondisclosure policy forbids.,00:14:20
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,He had a nosebleed before. Is he okay?,00:14:23
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Why?,00:14:28
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,Why?,00:14:29
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Why?,00:14:30
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,He's Department Chief.,00:14:33
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Dylan is. In Mark's absence.,00:14:34
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,Kinda like you and Cobel. Replace one part with another.,00:14:38
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,"That's enough, Helly R.",00:14:46
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,Don't you mean Helly E?,00:14:54
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Helena Eagan is my employer. You are my subordinate and this behavior constitutes insubordination.,00:14:59
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,"Yeah, no shit.",00:15:09
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Leave it open.,00:15:16
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,I told you about us.,00:15:33
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,What?,00:15:39
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,I told my husband about you and me this morning.,00:15:42
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,Was he glad for us?,00:15:55
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,No.,00:15:58
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,"Well, he should be because I'm… I'm making you happy.",00:16:03
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,I know.,00:16:09
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,And he's not.,00:16:10
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,I can't see you anymore. He threatened to quit. And I don't know if he's still going to. But maybe if I tell him that this is over–,00:16:14
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,No. Hold on.,00:16:26
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,This is all my fault. I never should have come here.,00:16:29
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,"Wait. Gretchen, my life started when you came here.",00:16:33
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,That's not true. You have so much going for you.,00:16:37
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,"No, I have nothing else. I have this and I have fucking pencil erasers.",00:16:41
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,"I'm sorry, I have to go.",00:16:49
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,"No, wait, wait. Gretchen G–",00:16:51
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,"Oh, my God.",00:16:57
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,"I love you. And I know I'm just an innie, but I love you all the way, I do.",00:17:01
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,Gretchen… I made this for you. I can give you a life. Please.,00:17:06
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,I'm so sorry.,00:17:29
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,Gretchen. Gretchen!,00:17:34
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,You should keep it. Give it to someone you meet down here.,00:18:11
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,It's just O&D and the goat people.,00:18:18
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,That we know of.,00:18:23
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Gretchen,She's my wife.,00:18:28
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,She's not your wife… Because no one would treat someone they love the way she's treating you. Like all the outies treat us. Like everything's for them.,00:18:31
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,"Okay, well, what the fuck is there to do about it? At the end of the day, we're still stuck down here, with no lives and no family.",00:18:45
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,Irving was your family.,00:18:55
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,Dude.,00:18:57
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,"And he left you a message. The black hallway. I don't know if he knew where it leads, but he thought it was important and they convinced you to turn your back on him for some outie woman you don't even know.",00:19:00
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,"You know it's your fault we're down here at all, right?",00:19:13
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,"No, it's not.",00:19:18
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,"And if we're so different from our outies, then how come we couldn't tell when you were gone?",00:19:20
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,Irving could.,00:19:28
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,"Mark couldn't. Sorry, I guess I'm an asshole down here too.",00:19:32
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Cobel,"Hello, Mark. How are you?",00:20:42
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, my God, so good. My wife's being held prisoner at Lumon and I just got brain surgery in my basement. How have you been?",00:20:51
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Cobel,"We're allies now, there's no need to–",00:21:03
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"We're allies now, we're not neighbors anymore? Sorry, I just… I guess I'm confused.",00:21:04
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,"Can you… This birthing cabin, you can take us there, right? So we can talk to his innie.",00:21:09
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Cobel,"Not yet. Even under the cover of dark, it's perilous. We wait for night.",00:21:12
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,It's perilous. Okay.,00:21:18
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,You want us to wait until the evening?,00:21:20
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Cobel,We don't even know if he's completed the file yet. I assume no.,00:21:22
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,What file?,00:21:27
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Cobel,Cold Harbor. And if you've completed it… well…,00:21:40
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,“Well” what?,00:22:00
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Cobel,She's already dead.,00:22:05
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,Jesus Christ.,00:22:08
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,She better be fucking alive.,00:22:09
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,No! Fuck this. We're leaving. Right now.,00:22:15
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,"Hold on. Wait, Mark–",00:22:18
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Cobel,I'm trying to help you.,00:22:18
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,Mark.,00:22:20
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,She is there and we are out here in the middle of fucking nowhere.,00:22:21
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,"I know and we're gonna get her out, but listen, that's what we're doing here, right?",00:22:25
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Cobel,Call Mr. Milchick. Tell him you're unwell and won't be coming in today. Do it now.,00:22:31
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"Oh, my God.",00:22:40
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Cobel,"If he smells chicanery, he'll lock you out of the building.",00:22:42
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,How about fuck off?,00:22:46
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,Wait.,00:22:46
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,How about that? I mean…,00:22:46
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,Mark.,00:22:46
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"No, fuck that. No…",00:22:49
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,Hold on. Stop. Don't go anywhere.,00:22:49
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,…no fucking way.,00:22:51
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,"Mark, wait. Listen to me.",00:22:53
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,Absolutely not. Do you have any idea how insane she is?,00:22:54
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,"Yes, I do.",00:22:54
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,Do you know what she did?,00:22:57
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,"Mark, listen to me. Listen to me. Take a breath.",00:23:01
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"No, I can't. We can't do it.",00:23:01
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Devon,"Mark, there is literally no other option than to do what the fuck she says right now. For Gemma. She knows where she is, Mark.",00:23:05
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Helly,"Okay, Irving.",00:23:55
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,Fuck this place.,00:24:38
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,I never hurt anyone. I want you to know that. I drove people places. I didn't ask what happened to them once they get there.,00:25:07
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Irving,Is that what today is?,00:25:30
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,I'm sure you know this is very disappointing and reeks of ingratitude.,00:25:55
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,Done. Anything else?,00:26:06
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Key card. Please report to the elevator and wait.,00:26:09
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Ms. Huang,"I'm sorry, Dylan G. I should have facilitated better.",00:26:32
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,That's enough.,00:26:42
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Dylan,It's not your fault.,00:26:48
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,"So this is “tightening the leash”? Our most vital refiner missing in the wind, on what was to be Lumon's finest day. This is your fault.",00:27:00
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,"I have followed protocol, Mr. Drummond, but I thank you for your remonstration.",00:27:21
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,A needlessly complex word for a simple idea. Apologize for the word.,00:27:30
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Sir–,00:27:41
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,Apologize for the word.,00:27:41
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,I apologize.,00:27:50
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,Shorter.,00:27:53
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,I'm sorry.,00:28:00
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,Again.,00:28:02
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Mr. Drummond…,00:28:06
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,Again.,00:28:09
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,"Devour feculence. It means “eat shit,” Mr. Drummond.",00:28:18
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Drummond,What did you just say to me?,00:28:34
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,"I am manager of the severed floor, which means two things. First, I am owed a measure of respect, even by my superiors. Second, and more obvious, that said floor comprises the whole of my jurisdiction. To put that monosyllabically, it's not my fault what Mark Scout does when he is not at work. It's yours.",00:28:40
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Mr. Scout. Where are you?,00:29:54
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"Well, I'm… I was worried about these nosebleeds. So we drove to this clinic out in Soil Hill and, you know, they want to do a few more tests.",00:29:59
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Let me send a car. You are a priority employee and you should be under Lumon care. May I get your exact location?,00:30:14
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,I…,00:30:23
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Mr. Scout?,00:30:26
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"I'm not sick. I just needed the day, okay?",00:30:38
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,May I ask why?,00:30:50
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"No. I've just got life stuff. Isn't that what Lumon's all about? Balance? I mean, work is just work, right? Do you know what I mean, Mr. Milchick? Mr. Milchick?",00:30:55
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,I have your word you report to work tomorrow?,00:31:47
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Mark,"You do. Yeah, I'll be there. I promise.",00:31:55
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Milchick,Good. And thank you for calling.,00:31:59
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Ticket Clerk,"Here you go, sir.",00:32:45
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,Thanks.,00:32:46
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,This line goes as far as you can go. I can't know where you get off. And you can never come back to Kier. Do you understand?,00:32:59
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Irving,No. Won't Lumon come after you?,00:33:16
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,You asked me why I severed… I liked the idea that I could be innocent again. Part of me. But then my innocent part fell in love with you.,00:33:28
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Irving,I want to remember it.,00:33:53
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,Probably better we don't.,00:33:57
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Irving,I've never been loved before. Not really.,00:34:03
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,"Well, now you have. How does it feel?",00:34:09
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Irving,I don't know. I… Don't you want to know how it felt?,00:34:16
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,It's not possible.,00:34:24
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Irving,Burt…,00:34:28
2,9,The After Hours (Transcript),Burt,It's okay. Just go.,00:34:29

2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Then she's still alive. We can save her.,00:02:08
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,Who?,00:02:16
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Ms. Casey.,00:02:19
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,Gemma.,00:02:21
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,There's a hallway down there. It's different than the others. It's long and black and hidden.,00:02:25
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,From Irving's drawings.,00:02:34
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,What?,00:02:37
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,With an elevator going down. We know where it is.,00:02:40
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Jame,What a funny speech you gave at the party. I was cross with you after. I threw a tin of candies.,00:02:55
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,"God, you're fucking weird.",00:03:19
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Jame,"I do not love my daughter. I used to see Kier in her, but he left her as she grew.",00:03:47
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,You sound like a great dad.,00:04:04
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Jame,I sired others in the shadows. But he wasn't in them either. Until I saw him again. In you.,00:04:07
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,"You and your family created hell, and you're going to burn in it.",00:04:29
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Jame,There he is. Tomorrow is a special day.,00:04:41
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,Hey! Why did you come here? What do you want from me?,00:04:51
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"So… wait, when I finish Cold Harbor, they do a test, and then th-they kill her?",00:05:03
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,"Once that file is done, you'll need to quickly get to the black hallway, then down to the testing floor. They'll not let you leave MDR till that file is complete.",00:05:10
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Okay, but how do I find her once I'm down there?",00:05:23
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,"Oh. No, you won't.",00:05:25
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,I won't?,00:05:26
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,No.,00:05:26
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,"Your chip is only attuned to your floor. Once you get down to testing, you'll be your outie again.",00:05:28
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,And then he'll find Gemma and take her up to the severed floor.,00:05:36
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Where you will guide her to the exit stairwell.,00:05:39
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Mark,Right. Okay.,00:05:46
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,"Mark… I know this is a fucking lot, man. But if we can prove that she is alive, if we can prove that they fucking kidnapped her, it will end them.",00:05:50
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Well, what happens to us?",00:06:14
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,What do you mean?,00:06:18
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Well, if L-Lumon ends, then what happens to every innie on the severed floor?",00:06:22
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,Yeah. Um…,00:06:33
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,Oh.,00:06:43
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,You want me to give my life?,00:06:46
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,No.,00:06:46
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,The lives of everyone down there?,00:06:48
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,"No, it's not that simple.",00:06:50
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,Just to save one person you happen to care about?,00:06:54
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,It doesn't have to end your life.,00:06:58
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,Really?,00:07:04
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,"Right. Um… There's somebody else who wants to talk to you, actually. Um… Okay, just hit the play.",00:07:07
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,"Watch it. Record your response, then step outside.",00:07:43
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,"We'll just be downstairs, okay?",00:07:53
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,Okay.,00:07:55
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,"Hey… uh, I'm… Well, I guess you know who I am. Uh… I think you've spoken with Devon and Mrs. Sel… Uh, Ms. Cobel. So y… you know what it is that we're asking. But the first thing I need to say to you is that I am so sorry. You know, I created you as a-a prisoner and as an escape. Lumon told me you'd be happy, that innies are content, and because I took their word for it, you've been living a nightmare for two years. It's horrific what they've done to you. And part of the reason I'm here is to make it right. And I hope, uh, now with all we have in common, that you'll give me that chance.",00:08:19
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Uh, hi. Wow, this is, uh… I never expected to actually speak to you.",00:10:46
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,Holy shit.,00:10:54
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Um, let alone get an apology, so, uh… Thank you. Um, you know, “nightmare” is the wrong word, actually. 'Cause w-we find ways to make it work, to… to feel whole, which is why what you're asking scares me. You know, because… whatever this life is… it's all we have, and we don't want it to end. Can you understand that?",00:10:55
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,"Of course I can. It's such a good point. I'd say the same thing in-in your position, however, Lumon doesn't have to be your whole life. Now, you may have been seeing flashes lately. Images from my world out here. I've been seeing yours too. It's a process called “reintegration.” It's a way to recouple memories so we can be one person. I started this because I see now how unfair this all is to you, and once my wife is free, I swear I will finish the process. 'Cause this life, our life… belongs to both of us. And I wanna share it with you.",00:12:06
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Uh, okay. But… what would that mean exactly? That y-y-you get the right side, and I get the-the left? Or… Is it like a top-bottom situation? I'm honestly trying to understand.",00:13:10
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,"No, no, it wouldn't be like a top-bottom situation. It's, like, both of us. Like, one person combined. Like, my memories and yours, and my trauma and yours, but, like, you know, the good stuff too.",00:13:22
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Okay, but… I mean, you've been alive for, what, 20 times longer, so whoever this new hybrid person is, it seems like he'd be way more you than me.",00:13:40
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,I just don't think that's how it works.,00:13:59
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,Okay. How does it work?,00:14:03
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,"Look… I mourned Gemma for two years. I lost my job, my teaching job… because I fucking started showing up drunk. You know, I hid all of her stuff in my basement… 'cause it was easier pretending that she never existed. And I thought I was protecting you from that pain. Oh, hey, uh, Ms. Cobel told me you-you like someone down there? Helena Eagan, right? I think her innie name's “Heleny”? Honestly, I love that you had that experience. So, now… you could imagine, like, what you and Heleny have but multiply, like, thousands of days of, like, joy, and arguments, and passion, then you can see why I have to get my wife back. I have to have her back.",00:14:28
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"It's Helly, actually. Helly. It's the person I'm in love with, which you'd know if you'd ever taken an interest in my life. Before tonight, when you need something. She's the person I'll lose if I do what you say 'cause you know as well as I do that her outie won't, like, reintegrate, assuming that's even real. Assuming every word outta your mouth isn't a lie.",00:16:25
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,Wha…,00:16:58
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,"Whoa. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to… Dude, I'm just trying to save my wife, okay? I mean, I can't abandon her, and if you help me, I won't abandon you. I promise.",00:17:02
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"You know what I think? I think the second you get your wife back, you forget I ever existed. I think that I disappear along with every innie down there.",00:17:17
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,What do you want from me? We are in this together. Can't you just trust me?,00:17:27
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,No.,00:17:38
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,Devon! He's a fucking child. He won't listen.,00:17:41
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Let me speak to him.,00:17:46
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Outie Mark,"I mentioned reintegration, he basically called bullshit.",00:17:47
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,"Well, he's not wrong, right?",00:17:50
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Let me speak to him. Alone.,00:17:52
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,Okay. Yeah.,00:17:58
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Mark,Okay.,00:18:08
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,"The numbers are your wife. The MDR numbers. From your console. They're a doorway into the mind of your outie's wife, Gemma Scout.",00:18:23
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,I don't understand.,00:18:56
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,What do you see every day when you look at them?,00:19:02
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,What… we feel things.,00:19:13
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,What do you feel?,00:19:21
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Mmm, different things. Sometimes sadness…",00:19:25
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Woe. Frolic. Malice. Dread.,00:19:29
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,So you're saying… the… the clusters are…,00:19:44
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Her tempers. The building blocks of her mind.,00:19:49
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,What am I building?,00:19:59
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Every file you've completed… is a new consciousness for her. A new innie.,00:20:05
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,I've completed 24 files.,00:20:27
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,"Cold Harbor is the last. Tomorrow will be your final day at Lumon. You will have served your purpose, and so will she.",00:20:31
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Wait, why are you telling me this? What are you doing here, really?",00:20:58
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Mark. Mark. Oh… There'll be no honeymoon ending for you and Helly R. She's an Eagan. You're nothing to them.,00:21:10
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,No.,00:21:32
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Nothing to her.,00:21:32
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"No, I don't believe you.",00:21:34
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,They're using you.,00:21:36
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,No! I don't believe you!,00:21:37
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Then they'll discard you like a skin husk.,00:21:39
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,I think you're using me!,00:21:41
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,Mark! Wait.,00:21:41
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Reintegration is your only chance!,00:21:44
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,Do you love your brother?,00:21:46
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,Mark!,00:21:46
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,Yes.,00:21:49
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Well, then you tell him that the next thing I see had better be the severed floor, or I swear he will never see his wife again.",00:21:50
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cobel,I care for you.,00:21:57
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,Stop!,00:21:59
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Devon,Mark.,00:22:00
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,I have to tell you something.,00:23:11
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,Me too.,00:23:13
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,Fuck me.,00:24:08

2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,I know why. I know why they're doing this.,00:26:19
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Milchick,"Hello, Dylan.",00:26:43
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Dylan,He said no?,00:26:47

2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,"So, what happens when they extract the chip? But how can we trust anything Cobel says? All she's ever done is lie.",00:27:31
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"I know, but she seemed different. I mean, she's the same, but… like, different same. I don't know. I mean, I could just not do it. I could just not finish the file, not get her out.",00:27:46
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,"But if she's telling the truth, we're screwed either way.",00:28:11
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Gemma,What's happening?,00:28:21
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Cecily,Just get dressed. Everything is gonna be fine.,00:28:23
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,"But if you get her out, maybe that will take down Lumon, like his sister said. And maybe you can do this combining thing.",00:28:33
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Well, yeah, but he could be a total liar.",00:28:47
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,What if he's not? At least you'll have a chance at living.,00:28:51
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Yeah, but I wanna live with you.",00:29:06

2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Dylan,"“Dear innie, I've read your request and organized my response into three points. Point one: fuck you. Gretchen is my wife and my beloved, and your actions with her were deeply fucking indecorous. Point two: I get it. She's perfect, and given our shared physiology, it tracks that you'd agree. Here's the thing. I've never been an impressive person, so when Gretch told me that you're, like, this self-assured badass, I don't know. Uh, it stung. So I guess, point three is: I hope someday she sees in me what she sees in you. In the meantime… if I'm being really honest, I guess I like knowing you're there. So if you wanna leave, you can. But I think you should stay. Sincerest regards, Your outie.”",00:31:18

2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,"Maybe it's just a building that's, like, so big…",00:34:27
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Helly,That it became a continent.,00:34:32
2,9,Cold Harbor (Transcript),Innie Mark,Yeah.,00:34:34
