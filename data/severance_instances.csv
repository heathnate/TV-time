0,Mark,1,1,Good News About Hell,1,"You see, you have been hired to a position on the Severed Floor of Lumon Industries."
1,Mark,1,1,Good News About Hell,2,"I understand you’re confused about the severance procedure. Before we hop on that, let’s chat about something I bet you have heard of, the work/life balance. To start, imagine yourself as a seesaw."
2,Helly,1,1,Good News About Hell,3,"My name is Helly R. I’m making this video roughly two hours before it will be shown to me. I have, of my own free accord, elected to undergo the procedure colloquially known as severance. I give consent for my perceptual chronologies to be surgically split, separating my memories between my work life and my personal life. I acknowledge that, henceforth, my access to my memories will be spatially dictated. I will be unable to access outside recollections whilst on Lumon’s severed basement floor, nor retain work memories upon my ascent. I am aware that this alteration is comprehensive and irreversible. I make these statements freely."
3,Helly,1,1,Good News About Hell,4,"My name is Helly R. I’m making this video roughly two hours before it will be shown to me. I have, of my own free accord, elected to undergo the procedure colloquially known as severance. I give consent for my perceptual chronologies to be surgically split, separating my memories between my work life and my personal life. I acknowledge that, henceforth, my access to my memories will be spatially dictated. I will be unable to access outside recollections whilst on Lumon’s severed basement floor, nor retain work memories upon my ascent. I am aware that this alteration is comprehensive and irreversible. I make these statements freely."
4,Ricken,1,1,Good News About Hell,5,Mark’s work is sensitive enough as to require the severance procedure.
5,Petey,1,1,Good News About Hell,6,Severed. Severed. I was.
6,Petey,1,1,Good News About Hell,7,Severed. Severed. I was.
7,Mark,1,1,Good News About Hell,8,"Okay. Well, severance is pretty permanent."
8,Helly,1,2,Half Loop,9,"I acknowledge that, henceforth, my access to my memories will be spatially dictated. I will be unable to access outside recollections whilst on Lumon’s severed basement floor, nor retain work memories upon my ascent. I am aware that this alteration is comprehensive and irreversible. I make these statements freely."
9,Milchick,1,2,Half Loop,10,"So, your work personage will be waking in a few hours on the severed floor. But the next time you yourself will be sentient will be this evening, in the elevator back up."
10,Milchick,1,2,Half Loop,11,"Okay, so sometimes when a new hire is adjusting to a severed space, we help by bringing them here to the stairwell, to experience the transition viscerally."
11,WMC Activist 2,1,2,Half Loop,12,And legalized severance in the workplace?
12,WMC Activist 1,1,2,Half Loop,13,Most severed workers don’t see the sun their whole lives.
13,WMC Activist 1,1,2,Half Loop,14,We’re trying to get a measure on the ballot to keep mega-corporations like Lumon from continuing to force legalized severance on our state.
14,WMC Activist 2,1,2,Half Loop,15,That’s what they’re lobbying for. And Jame Eagan is trying to sever kids…
15,Mark,1,2,Half Loop,16,"Okay, well, what about the self-mutilating types who do it willingly? I mean, I heard that some of them are so deluded they don’t even know they’re victims. I also heard that if you’re severed, you go to two separate hells. Is that true?"
16,WMC Activist 1,1,2,Half Loop,17,"Severance is subjugation, asshole."
17,Mark,1,2,Half Loop,18,"Mr. Milchick, it’s Mark Scout. I’m a severed worker. Employee number 4502."
18,Dylan,1,2,Half Loop,19,"Yeah. Think about it. Okay, if our Outies are up there severing their brains, shit must have gotten pretty bad. Famine, plagues, et cetera. So what is a desperate humanity to do?"
19,Petey,1,2,Half Loop,20,"I don’t know. I thought without severance it would make more sense, but… They separate us from the other departments. We don’t even know how many there are. But I’ve been reintegrated for two weeks now. I’ve been mapping out the floor. I hid the original for you when I left."
20,Petey,1,3,In Perpetuity,21,“They” is a group of people that know severance is a blight on mankind. And they’re gonna do something about it.
21,Steven,1,3,In Perpetuity,22,"But what do you say, Natalie, to the woman who became pregnant at work less than a month after her company went severed?"
22,Natalie,1,3,In Perpetuity,23,That has nothing to do with what we do at Lumon nor any severance procedure.
23,Natalie,1,3,In Perpetuity,24,"Okay. So, the Board is conveying pretty strongly that the severance procedure is provenly irreversible."
24,Natalie,1,3,In Perpetuity,25,And that this knowledge should be a given for a person managing a severed floor.
25,Mark,1,4,The You You Are,26,So why would they be on a map of the severed floor?
26,Ricken (voicemail),1,5,The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design,27,"\\Hi, Mark, it’s Ricken. Listen, I know you’re still in, um, severed Mark form, but, uh, Devon’s at 4 centimeters, so, this baby is officially coming. Uh, we’re headed to the birthing retreat now, so, please come."
27,Dylan,1,6,Hide and Seek,28,"Well, maybe love transcends severance."
28,Reghabi,1,7,Defiant Jazz,29,"Then again, you’ve been severed for two years, right? So your Innie really is still just a baby."
29,Reghabi,1,7,Defiant Jazz,30,He’s Doug Graner. Head of security on the severed floor.
30,Devon,1,7,Defiant Jazz,31,"Mark’s company, Lumon, they say that they only sever people for work. But I was thinking, what if someone… Like, what if you wanted a baby, but you didn’t wanna…"
31,Cobel,1,7,Defiant Jazz,32,Severed. Why do you think Mark did it?
32,Irving,1,7,Defiant Jazz,33,"You’re not severed. You walk out of here with your memories. You carry them home with you every night. No one can rip them away from you, snuff them out. Like they never existed. Like you never existed!"
33,Mark,1,8,What’s for Dinner?,34,"This severance thing, it… Not sure I need it anymore."
34,Gabby,1,9,The We We Are,35,"I mean, the idea that people would want to outlaw severance."
35,Helly,1,9,The We We Are,36,But I took a severed job because it sounds freaking awesome.
36,Helly,1,9,The We We Are,37,"So, no, I don’t think severance divides us. I think it brings us together."
37,Devon,1,9,The We We Are,38,Which is why I guess you thought the severed job would…
38,Natalie,1,9,The We We Are,39,"…decided that we could do better. He may never have seen a severance chip in his lifetime, but it represents his gentle and elegant vision made manifest."
39,Helly,1,9,The We We Are,40,And everything they’ve told you about severance is a lie!
40,Milchick,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",41,Ms. Cobel is no longer with this company. I now manage the severed floor.
41,Milchick,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",42,"We didn't fire them. Helly R. and Irving B. both successfully made contact with persons on the outside, just as you did. Dylan G.'s outie learned what happened after the fact. The four of you have achieved international fame. As a group, you've become known as the face of severance reform."
42,Mark S,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",43,Severance ref–
43,Milchick,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",44,"“Dear Outie, I don't know if this will reach you, but I'm writing to alert you of the heinous conditions in the severed office to which you have transferred me. The branch is run by a shambolic rube who goes by Milkshake.”"
44,Mark S,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",45,"Hello? Is anyone there? Is the Board on? It's Mark S. from Macrodata Refinement. Okay. Well, if you're there, please listen. Now, I know that you want to do the right thing for severed people, which is why I need to see my team again."
45,Mark S,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",46,"If we truly are the face of severance reform, as you say, then they deserve a chance."
46,Lumon Building,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",47,"Hi. You probably don't recognize me from this angle. I'm the Lumon Administrative Building, branch 501. And you're sitting in me right now. The name's a mouthful, or as I say, a “doorful.” So you can just call me Lumon. I've gone through a lot of changes since my siring here in 1870. But one thing I've always had is a love for my workers, both unsevered and severed. Not to brag, but my basement floor is one of the premier severed workspaces in the 206 countries from which Lumon operates. Hey, no running in my halls! That tickles. But what makes a building truly happy? This question came to light when four MDR workers, dissatisfied with their severed lives, conspired to mount what Lumon historians will forever call the Macrodat Uprising. Under my literal nose unfolded a human drama of danger and intrigue. Righteous anger."
47,Lumon Building,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",48,"Hi. You probably don't recognize me from this angle. I'm the Lumon Administrative Building, branch 501. And you're sitting in me right now.

48,Lumon Building,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",49,"Hi. You probably don't recognize me from this angle. I'm the Lumon Administrative Building, branch 501. And you're sitting in me right now.

49,Milchick,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",50,"I know we have our differences… but I want you to know that I truly respect each and every one of you. And I don't wanna be your jailer. By end of day, each of you will choose whether you want to remain here. Not your outies, but you. If you start work on your file, I'll assume you want to stay. If not, I'll send you to the surface. No ill will. Maybe I'll even buy you a drink at a bistro one day. Like the rest of the severed floor, the break room has no cameras or microphones. Privacy shouldn't mean packing into a supply closet like so many sardines. I truly hope you all will choose to stay and enjoy what you've helped build. A new quarter. A fresh start. For all of us."
50,Mark S,2,1,"Hello, Ms. Cobel",51,"Which, apparently, is part of why I decided to get severed. Except… the woman in the photo was Ms. Casey."
51,Helly,2,2,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig",52,And the severed employees who were involved are being dealt with.
52,Helly,2,2,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig",53,Severance Advisory Council.
53,Cobel,2,2,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig",54,Which is why I should be running the severed floor.
54,Helly,2,2,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig",55,at an event where I was excited to share my status as a severed individual
55,Dylan,2,2,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig",56,"I was a severed employee, so…"
56,Mr. Saliba,2,2,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig",57,You're a severed?
57,Dylan,2,2,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig",58,That's it? Just because I'm severed?
58,Milchick,2,2,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig",59,you cited her death as a primary motivator for severing.
59,Mark,2,2,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig",60,"Now, I know that you want to do the right thing for severed people,"
60,Mark,2,2,"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig",61,"If we truly are the face of severance reform, as you say,"
61,Natalie,2,3,Who Is Alive?,62,has found its way onto our severed floor.
62,Natalie,2,3,Who Is Alive?,63,"Can I just say, your brother is one of the sweetest members of our severed team."
63,Milchick,2,4,Woe's Hollow,64,"Dieter Eagan? Some of you may be quietly yearning to learn more. The truth you seek lies within the fourth appendix. Kier dictated a fourth appendix in his final hours of life, a text of such sanctity that it is forbidden upon the severed floor. It's waiting for you in Scissor Cave, the very same grotto where Kier Eagan tamed the four tempers for the very first time."
64,Irving,2,4,Woe's Hollow,65,So if you're not her… then who are you? Who would have the power to send their outie to the severed floor?
65,Milchick,2,4,Woe's Hollow,66,"Please refrain from any further speech, as you are no longer authorized to consort with any severed employee, nor they with you."
66,Drummond,2,5,Trojan's Horse,67,"This milestone seems to have clouded your judgment. I think it's time to go back to the basics, Seth. To remember these severed workers' greater purpose… and to treat them as what they really are."
67,Ricken,2,5,Trojan's Horse,68,"Well, it's a Trojan's horse. If I can get my ideas to severed workers all across the world, it might beget a revolution."
68,Burt,2,5,Trojan's Horse,69,"It wasn't you at all, was it? You're severed. I got canned a couple of weeks ago. When I pressed them for a reason, they said my innie had an unsanctioned, erotic entanglement with another worker. They wouldn't tell me who. Then you show up at my door."
69,Helly,2,6,Attila,70,Did everyone sever their balls in the elevator this morning?
70,Miss Huang,2,6,Attila,71,You have two minutes left. Humidity on the severed floor is maintained at a consistent 45%. It must be something else. Did you punch him?
71,Helena,2,6,Attila,72,Severance humor. That's so clever.
72,Mark,2,6,Attila,73,Okay. Yeah. About severance?
73,Irving,2,6,Attila,74,Didn't the first severed office open 12 years ago?
74,Burt,2,6,Attila,75,"He's fine. He'll be embarrassed tomorrow. You know, he gets fuzzy. Like saying I worked at Lumon 20 years ago, which is, of course, before severance even existed."
75,Drummond,2,7,Chikhai Bardo,76,Are the severance barriers holding?
76,Devon,2,7,Chikhai Bardo,77,"There… I mean, it's technically… It's a cottage where severed people become their innies, and there was this woman–"
77,Reghabi,2,7,Chikhai Bardo,78,What? Why would you do that? She runs the severed floor.
78,Milchick,2,9,The After Hours,79,"I am manager of the severed floor, which means two things. First, I am owed a measure of respect, even by my superiors. Second, and more obvious, that said floor comprises the whole of my jurisdiction. To put that monosyllabically, it's not my fault what Mark Scout does when he is not at work. It's yours."
79,Devon,2,10,Cold Harbor,80,And then he'll find Gemma and take her up to the severed floor.
80,Innie Mark,2,10,Cold Harbor,81,"Well, if L-Lumon ends, then what happens to every innie on the severed floor?"
81,Innie Mark,2,10,Cold Harbor,82,"Well, then you tell him that the next thing I see had better be the severed floor, or I swear he will never see his wife again."
